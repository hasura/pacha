# Evaluation

There are some evaluation queries for the Spagila dataset categorized by difficulty in `spagila`.

The database can be set by running the SQL scripts in `spagila/db_schema/dump.sql` and `spagila/db_schema/schema_mods.sql` one after another.

Evaluation results of past code are present in `runs`. You can look at the commmands used for previous runs in their READMEs to see how to run evals.
