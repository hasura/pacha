=== INPUT ===
show me city/state/phone number for all the stores that have Core Suit in stock

=== OUTPUT ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
To add context to this conversation, I need to retrieve the store information and inventory data from the database. Specifically, I need to retrieve the city, state, and phone number of stores that have "Core Suit" in stock.

```
data = executor.get_from_database("SELECT loc.city, loc.state_distr, loc.phone_num, catalog.store_id FROM catalog JOIN loc ON catalog.store_id = loc.id WHERE catalog.film_id IN (SELECT id FROM movie WHERE title = 'Core Suit')")
if len(data) == 0:
  executor.output('No stores have Core Suit in stock')
else:
  for row in data:
    executor.output(f'Store {row["store_id"]} is located in {row["city"]}, {row["state_distr"]} and can be reached at {row["phone_num"]}')
```
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
The error message indicates that the column "city" does not exist in the "loc" table. After reviewing the database schema, I found that the correct column name is "addr1" and "addr2" for address, "city_id" for city, and "state_distr" for state or district. Also, "phone_num" is the correct column name for phone number.

Here is the corrected script:

```
data = executor.get_from_database("SELECT loc.addr1, loc.addr2, muni.city, loc.state_distr, loc.phone_num, catalog.store_id FROM catalog JOIN loc ON catalog.store_id = loc.id JOIN muni ON loc.city_id = muni.id WHERE catalog.film_id IN (SELECT id FROM movie WHERE title = 'Core Suit')")
if len(data) == 0:
  executor.output('No stores have Core Suit in stock')
else:
  for row in data:
    executor.output(f'Store {row["store_id"]} is located at {row["addr1"]} {row["addr2"]}, {row["city"]}, {row["state_distr"]} and can be reached at {row["phone_num"]}')
```
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===
No stores have Core Suit in stock
