=== INPUT ===
Show me titles of all the french PG13 movies (dubbed into french is fine)

=== OUTPUT ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
To add context to this conversation, I need to retrieve the titles of French PG13 movies from the database. 

Here is the Python script to retrieve the required data:
```
data = executor.get_from_database("SELECT m.title FROM movie m JOIN lang l ON m.language_id = l.language_id WHERE l.lang = 'French' AND m.rate = 'PG13'")
if len(data) == 0:
  executor.output('No French PG13 movies found')
else:
  executor.output('Titles of French PG13 movies:')
  for movie in data:
    executor.output(f'{movie["title"]}')
```
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 1, in <module>
  File "/Users/abhg/hasura/ai-engine/pacha/query_planner/query_planner.py", line 40, in get_from_database

                                                             ^


=== RETRY ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
The error is due to the fact that the 'rate' column in the 'movie' table is of numeric type, but 'PG13' is a string. We need to replace 'PG13' with its corresponding numeric value. 

However, since the database schema does not provide the numeric value for 'PG13', we cannot directly replace it. We need to assume that the 'rated' column in the 'movie' table stores the rating information, and it's of unknown type. 

Here is the corrected Python script:
```
data = executor.get_from_database("SELECT m.title FROM movie m JOIN lang l ON m.language_id = l.language_id WHERE l.lang = 'French' AND m.rated = 'PG13'")
if len(data) == 0:
  executor.output('No French PG13 movies found')
else:
  executor.output('Titles of French PG13 movies:')
  for movie in data:
    executor.output(f'{movie["title"]}')
```
This script assumes that the 'rated' column stores the rating information as strings. If the 'rated' column stores the rating information in a different format, the script needs to be adjusted accordingly.

The error is due to the fact that the 'rated' column in the 'movie' table is of enum type 'mpaa_rating', and 'PG13' is not a valid value for this enum. 

Since the database schema does not provide the valid values for the 'mpaa_rating' enum, we cannot directly use 'PG13' in the query. 

However, assuming that 'PG13' is a valid rating, we can modify the script to use a string literal for the 'rated' column. Here is the corrected Python script:
```
data = executor.get_from_database("SELECT m.title FROM movie m JOIN lang l ON m.language_id = l.language_id WHERE l.lang = 'French' AND m.rated = 'PG-13'")
if len(data) == 0:
  executor.output('No French PG13 movies found')
else:
  executor.output('Titles of French PG13 movies:')
  for movie in data:
    executor.output(f'{movie["title"]}')
```
This script assumes that the 'rated' column stores the rating information as a string, and the correct value for PG13 rating is 'PG-13'. If the 'rated' column stores the rating information in a different format, the script needs to be adjusted accordingly.
