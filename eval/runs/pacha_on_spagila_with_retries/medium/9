=== QUERY PLAN ===
To add context to this conversation, I need to retrieve the full names of employees who handled a transaction along with the id of the rental transaction, for all rentals handled by an employee no longer working here.

Here is the Python script to retrieve the required data:
```
inactive_employees = executor.get_from_database("SELECT id FROM team WHERE active = FALSE")
if len(inactive_employees) == 0:
  executor.output('No inactive employees found')
else:
  inactive_employee_ids = [employee['id'] for employee in inactive_employees]
  data = executor.get_from_database(f"SELECT t.first_name, t.last_name, tr.id FROM trans tr JOIN team t ON tr.staff_id = t.id WHERE tr.staff_id IN ({','.join(map(str, inactive_employee_ids))})")
  if len(data) == 0:
    executor.output('No transactions found for inactive employees')
  else:
    for row in data:
      executor.output(f'Full name: {row["first_name"]} {row["last_name"]}, Rental transaction ID: {row["id"]}')
```
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===
No inactive employees found
