=== OUTPUT ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
To answer this question, we need to retrieve the total number of rentals and the total number of customers from the database. 

```
rentals_data = executor.get_from_database("SELECT COUNT(id) AS total_rentals FROM trans")
customers_data = executor.get_from_database("SELECT COUNT(id) AS total_customers FROM patron")

if len(rentals_data) == 0 or len(customers_data) == 0:
  executor.output('No data found')
else:
  total_rentals = rentals_data[0]["total_rentals"]
  total_customers = customers_data[0]["total_customers"]
  if total_customers == 0:
    executor.output('No customers found')
  else:
    avg_rentals_per_customer = total_rentals / total_customers
    executor.output(f'Average number of video rentals per customer across all stores: {avg_rentals_per_customer}')
```
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===
Average number of video rentals per customer across all stores: 26.784641068447414
