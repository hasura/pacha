=== INPUT ===
Has Tom Cruise done any films in Spanish?

=== OUTPUT ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
To add context to this conversation, I would like to retrieve data about Tom Cruise's filmography, specifically looking for films where the language is Spanish.

```
data = executor.get_from_database("SELECT m.title, l.lang FROM movie m JOIN movie_cm mc ON m.id = mc.film_id JOIN cm_info ci ON mc.id = ci.id JOIN lang l ON m.language_id = l.language_id WHERE ci.given_name = 'Tom' AND ci.surname = 'Cruise' AND l.lang = 'Spanish'")
if len(data) == 0:
  executor.output('No films in Spanish found for Tom Cruise')
else:
  for film in data:
    executor.output(f'Tom Cruise has starred in the Spanish film: {film["title"]}')
```
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===
No films in Spanish found for Tom Cruise
