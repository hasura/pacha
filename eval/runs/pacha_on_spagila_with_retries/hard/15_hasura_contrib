Suggest a children's' movie by popularity

=== OUTPUT ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
Here's a suggestion: 

To provide a suggestion, I would like to retrieve the top-rated children's movies from the database. 

```
data = executor.get_from_database("SELECT title, rate FROM movie WHERE rated = 'G' ORDER BY rate DESC LIMIT 1")
if len(data) == 0:
  executor.output('No children\'s movies found')
else:
  executor.output(f'Top-rated children\'s movie: {data[0]["title"]} with a rating of {data[0]["rate"]}')
```
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===
Top-rated children's movie: ACE GOLDFINGER with a rating of 4.99
