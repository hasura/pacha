=== QUERY PLAN ===
To add context to this conversation, I would like to retrieve data on the top-performing regions in terms of sales.

```
data = executor.get_from_database("SELECT store, total_sales FROM sales_by_store ORDER BY total_sales DESC LIMIT 5")
if len(data) == 0:
  executor.output('No sales data found')
else:
  executor.output('Top 5 performing regions by sales:')
  for i, row in enumerate(data):
    executor.output(f'Rank {i+1}: {row["store"]} - Total Sales: {row["total_sales"]}')
```
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===
Top 5 performing regions by sales:
Rank 1: Hamilton,New Zealand - Total Sales: 33726.77
Rank 2: Boksburg,South Africa - Total Sales: 33689.74
