=== INPUT ===
Give me a trend of stores by their efficiency over last 12 months (calculate the efficiency weekly for each store and then plot for me to get an idea which stores are improving efficiency)

=== OUTPUT ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
To provide a trend of stores by their efficiency over the last 12 months, I would need to retrieve data on the number of transactions (rentals) and the number of staff members at each store over the last 12 months. 

Here is a Python script to retrieve the necessary data:
```
# Retrieve the number of transactions (rentals) for each store over the last 12 months
rentals_data = executor.get_from_database("""
    SELECT 
        DATE_TRUNC('week', t.rental_date) AS week, 
        f.id AS store_id, 
        COUNT(t.id) AS num_rentals
    FROM 
        trans t 
    JOIN 
        franchise_unit f ON t.staff_id = f.id 
    WHERE 
        t.rental_date > NOW() - INTERVAL '12 months'
    GROUP BY 
        week, store_id
    ORDER BY 
        week, store_id
""")

# Retrieve the number of staff members at each store over the last 12 months
staff_data = executor.get_from_database("""
    SELECT 
        DATE_TRUNC('week', t.updated) AS week, 
        t.store_id, 
        COUNT(t.id) AS num_staff
    FROM 
        team t 
    WHERE 
        t.updated > NOW() - INTERVAL '12 months'
    GROUP BY 
        week, store_id
    ORDER BY 
        week, store_id
""")

# Calculate the efficiency for each store and week
efficiency_data = []
for week in set([row['week'] for row in rentals_data]):
    for store_id in set([row['store_id'] for row in rentals_data]):
        num_rentals = next((row['num_rentals'] for row in rentals_data if row['week'] == week and row['store_id'] == store_id), 0)
        num_staff = next((row['num_staff'] for row in staff_data if row['week'] == week and row['store_id'] == store_id), 0)
        if num_staff > 0:
            efficiency = num_rentals / num_staff
        else:
            efficiency = 0
        efficiency_data.append({
            'week': week,
            'store_id': store_id,
            'efficiency': efficiency
        })

# Output the efficiency data
executor.output('Efficiency data:')
for row in efficiency_data:
    executor.output(f'Week: {row["week"]}, Store ID: {row["store_id"]}, Efficiency: {row["efficiency"]}')
```
This script retrieves the number of transactions (rentals) and the number of staff members at each store over the last 12 months, and then calculates the efficiency for each store and week. The efficiency is calculated as the number of rentals divided by the number of staff members. The script outputs the efficiency data, which can be used to plot a trend of stores by their efficiency over the last 12 months.
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===
Efficiency data:
