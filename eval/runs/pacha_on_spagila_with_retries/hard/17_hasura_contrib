=== INPUT ===
Which Tom Cruise DVDs contain extra footage of him bragging about doing his own stunts?

=== OUTPUT ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
To add context to this conversation, I would like to retrieve data from the database that could help identify the specific Tom Cruise movies with extra footage of him discussing his stunts.

```
data = executor.get_from_database("SELECT m.title, mc.film_info FROM movie m JOIN movie_cm mc ON m.id = mc.film_id JOIN castmember c ON mc.id = c.id WHERE c.given_name = 'Tom' AND c.surname = 'Cruise' AND m.special_features LIKE '%behind the scenes%' OR m.special_features LIKE '%stunts%'")
if len(data) == 0:
  executor.output('No Tom Cruise movies with extra footage of him discussing stunts found')
else:
  for movie in data:
    executor.output(f'Tom Cruise movie "{movie["title"]}" contains extra footage of him discussing stunts: {movie["film_info"]}')
```
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===

HINT:  Perhaps you meant to reference the column "mc.film_id".


=== RETRY ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
The error message indicates that the column `mc.film_info` does not exist in the `movie_cm` table. Upon reviewing the database schema, I see that the `cm_info` table has a column named `film_info`, not the `movie_cm` table.

Here's the corrected script:

```
data = executor.get_from_database("SELECT m.title, ci.film_info FROM movie m JOIN movie_cm mc ON m.id = mc.film_id JOIN cm_info ci ON mc.id = ci.id JOIN castmember c ON mc.id = c.id WHERE c.given_name = 'Tom' AND c.surname = 'Cruise' AND m.special_features LIKE '%behind the scenes%' OR m.special_features LIKE '%stunts%'")
if len(data) == 0:
  executor.output('No Tom Cruise movies with extra footage of him discussing stunts found')
else:
  for movie in data:
    executor.output(f'Tom Cruise movie "{movie["title"]}" contains extra footage of him discussing stunts: {movie["film_info"]}')
```

HINT:  No operator matches the given name and argument types. You might need to add explicit type casts.


=== RETRY ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
The error message indicates that the operator `~~` (LIKE) is not defined for the array type `text[]`. The `special_features` column in the `movie` table is of type `unknown`, which is likely an array type.

To fix this, we need to use the `ANY` function to check if any element in the `special_features` array matches the pattern. Here's the corrected script:

```
data = executor.get_from_database("SELECT m.title, ci.film_info FROM movie m JOIN movie_cm mc ON m.id = mc.film_id JOIN cm_info ci ON mc.id = ci.id JOIN castmember c ON mc.id = c.id WHERE c.given_name = 'Tom' AND c.surname = 'Cruise' AND ('behind the scenes' = ANY(m.special_features) OR 'stunts' = ANY(m.special_features))")
if len(data) == 0:
  executor.output('No Tom Cruise movies with extra footage of him discussing stunts found')
else:
  for movie in data:
    executor.output(f'Tom Cruise movie "{movie["title"]}" contains extra footage of him discussing stunts: {movie["film_info"]}')
```

This script uses the `ANY` function to check if the `special_features` array contains either 'behind the scenes' or 'stunts'.
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===
No Tom Cruise movies with extra footage of him discussing stunts found
