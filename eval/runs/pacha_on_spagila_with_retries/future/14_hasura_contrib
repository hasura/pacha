=== INPUT ===
Movies liked by people who liked similar movies as me

=== OUTPUT ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
To add context to this conversation, I would like to retrieve a list of movies that the user has liked or rented in the past. This information can be used to identify similar movies that the user might enjoy.

```
data = executor.get_from_database("SELECT m.title FROM trans t JOIN movie m ON t.inventory_id = m.id WHERE t.customer_id = (SELECT id FROM patron WHERE email_addr = '<user_email>')")
if len(data) == 0:
  executor.output('No movie rental history found for this user')
else:
  executor.output('Movies liked by this user:')
  for movie in data:
    executor.output(f'- {movie["title"]}')
```
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===
No movie rental history found for this user
