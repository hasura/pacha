=== INPUT ===
What are the 5 worst rated Tom Cruise movies that I haven't seen?

=== OUTPUT ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
To provide more context to the conversation, I would like to retrieve the list of Tom Cruise movies that the user has already seen.

Here is the Python script to retrieve the data:
```
seen_movies = executor.get_from_database("SELECT title FROM movie WHERE id IN (SELECT film_id FROM patron_list pl JOIN trans t ON pl.id = t.customer_id WHERE pl.id = ?)", (user_id,))
if len(seen_movies) == 0:
  executor.output('No movies seen by the user')
else:
  executor.output('Movies seen by the user: ' + ', '.join([movie["title"] for movie in seen_movies]))
  
worst_rated_cruise_movies = executor.get_from_database("SELECT title, rate FROM movie WHERE id IN (SELECT film_id FROM movie_cm WHERE id IN (SELECT id FROM cm_info WHERE given_name = 'Tom' AND surname = 'Cruise')) ORDER BY rate LIMIT 5")
if len(worst_rated_cruise_movies) == 0:
  executor.output('No Tom Cruise movies found')
else:
  worst_rated_cruise_movies = [movie for movie in worst_rated_cruise_movies if movie["title"] not in [seen_movie["title"] for seen_movie in seen_movies]]
  if len(worst_rated_cruise_movies) == 0:
    executor.output('All Tom Cruise movies have been seen by the user')
  else:
    executor.output('5 worst rated Tom Cruise movies not seen by the user: ' + ', '.join([f'{movie["title"]} ({movie["rate"]})' for movie in worst_rated_cruise_movies]))
```
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'user_id' is not defined

=== RETRY ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
The error is because the `user_id` variable is not defined in the script. To fix this, we need to define the `user_id` variable or replace it with the actual user ID from the database. Since we don't have the actual user ID, I'll assume it's 1 for this example. Here's the corrected script:
```
user_id = 1  # Replace with the actual user ID
seen_movies = executor.get_from_database("SELECT title FROM movie WHERE id IN (SELECT film_id FROM trans WHERE customer_id = ?)", (user_id,))
if len(seen_movies) == 0:
  executor.output('No movies seen by the user')
else:
  executor.output('Movies seen by the user: ' + ', '.join([movie["title"] for movie in seen_movies]))
  
worst_rated_cruise_movies = executor.get_from_database("SELECT title, rate FROM movie WHERE id IN (SELECT film_id FROM movie_cm WHERE id IN (SELECT id FROM cm_info WHERE given_name = 'Tom' AND surname = 'Cruise')) ORDER BY rate LIMIT 5")
if len(worst_rated_cruise_movies) == 0:
  executor.output('No Tom Cruise movies found')
else:
  worst_rated_cruise_movies = [movie for movie in worst_rated_cruise_movies if movie["title"] not in [seen_movie["title"] for seen_movie in seen_movies]]
  if len(worst_rated_cruise_movies) == 0:
    executor.output('All Tom Cruise movies have been seen by the user')
  else:
    executor.output('5 worst rated Tom Cruise movies not seen by the user: ' + ', '.join([f'{movie["title"]} ({movie["rate"]})' for movie in worst_rated_cruise_movies]))
```

TypeError: QueryPlanExecutorState.get_from_database() takes 2 positional arguments but 3 were given

=== RETRY ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
The error is because the `get_from_database` function takes only 1 argument, which is the SQL query, but we are passing 2 arguments (the SQL query and the user_id). To fix this, we need to remove the user_id from the function call and use string formatting to include the user_id in the SQL query. Here's the corrected script:
```
user_id = 1  # Replace with the actual user ID
seen_movies = executor.get_from_database("SELECT title FROM movie WHERE id IN (SELECT film_id FROM trans WHERE customer_id = {})".format(user_id))
if len(seen_movies) == 0:
  executor.output('No movies seen by the user')
else:
  executor.output('Movies seen by the user: ' + ', '.join([movie["title"] for movie in seen_movies]))
  
worst_rated_cruise_movies = executor.get_from_database("SELECT title, rate FROM movie WHERE id IN (SELECT film_id FROM movie_cm WHERE id IN (SELECT id FROM cm_info WHERE given_name = 'Tom' AND surname = 'Cruise')) ORDER BY rate LIMIT 5")
if len(worst_rated_cruise_movies) == 0:
  executor.output('No Tom Cruise movies found')
else:
  worst_rated_cruise_movies = [movie for movie in worst_rated_cruise_movies if movie["title"] not in [seen_movie["title"] for seen_movie in seen_movies]]
  if len(worst_rated_cruise_movies) == 0:
    executor.output('All Tom Cruise movies have been seen by the user')
  else:
    executor.output('5 worst rated Tom Cruise movies not seen by the user: ' + ', '.join([f'{movie["title"]} ({movie["rate"]})' for movie in worst_rated_cruise_movies]))
```

The error is because the `film_id` column does not exist in the `trans` table. The correct column name is `inventory_id`, which refers to the `inventory_id` in the `catalog` table, and then we can join the `catalog` table with the `movie` table to get the `film_id`.

Here's the corrected script:
```
user_id = 1  # Replace with the actual user ID
seen_movies = executor.get_from_database("SELECT m.title FROM movie m JOIN catalog c ON m.id = c.film_id WHERE c.inventory_id IN (SELECT inventory_id FROM trans WHERE customer_id = {})".format(user_id))
if len(seen_movies) == 0:
  executor.output('No movies seen by the user')
else:
  executor.output('Movies seen by the user: ' + ', '.join([movie["title"] for movie in seen_movies]))
  
worst_rated_cruise_movies = executor.get_from_database("SELECT title, rate FROM movie WHERE id IN (SELECT film_id FROM movie_cm WHERE id IN (SELECT id FROM cm_info WHERE given_name = 'Tom' AND surname = 'Cruise')) ORDER BY rate LIMIT 5")
