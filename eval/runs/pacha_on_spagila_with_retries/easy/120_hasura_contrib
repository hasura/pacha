=== INPUT ===
which of my customers have birthdays this month

=== OUTPUT ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
To add context to this conversation, I need to retrieve the customers' birthdates from the database. 

```
import datetime

current_month = datetime.datetime.now().month
data = executor.get_from_database("SELECT given_name, surname, email_addr FROM patron WHERE EXTRACT(MONTH FROM birthdate) = %s" % current_month)

if len(data) == 0:
  executor.output('No customers have birthdays this month')
else:
  for customer in data:
    executor.output(f'Customer {customer["given_name"]} {customer["surname"]} with email {customer["email_addr"]} has a birthday this month')
```
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
The error message indicates that the column "birthdate" does not exist in the "patron" table. 

Upon reviewing the database schema, I realize that the "patron" table does not have a "birthdate" column. 

To fix this, I need to know where the birthdate information is stored in the database. Unfortunately, the provided schema does not seem to have a birthdate column in any table. 

If the birthdate information is not available in the database, I cannot retrieve it.
