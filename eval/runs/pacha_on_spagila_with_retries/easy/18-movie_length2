=== INPUT ===
title and running time of all movies longer than 1.5 hours



=== OUTPUT ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
To add context to this conversation, I need to retrieve the titles and running times of movies that are longer than 1.5 hours from the database.

```
data = executor.get_from_database("SELECT title, length FROM movie WHERE length > 90")
if len(data) == 0:
  executor.output('No movies found with a running time longer than 1.5 hours')
else:
  for movie in data:
    executor.output(f'Title: {movie["title"]}, Running Time: {movie["length"]} minutes')
```
