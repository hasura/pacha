=== QUERY PLAN ===
To add context to this conversation, I need to retrieve the rating of the movie "Titanic" from the database.

```
data = executor.get_from_database("SELECT rated FROM movie WHERE title = 'Titanic'")
if len(data) == 0:
  executor.output('Movie "Titanic" not found')
else:
  rated = data[0].get("rated")
  if rated:
    executor.output(f'The movie "Titanic" is rated: {rated}')
  else:
    executor.output('Rating for "Titanic" not found')
```
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===
Movie "Titanic" not found
