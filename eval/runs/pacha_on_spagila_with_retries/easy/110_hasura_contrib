What is the longest Tom Cruise film?

=== OUTPUT ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
To answer this question, I would need to retrieve data from the database. 

I need to retrieve the title and length of Tom Cruise films from the database. 

Here is the Python script to do that:
```
data = executor.get_from_database("SELECT m.title, m.length FROM movie m JOIN movie_cm mc ON m.id = mc.film_id JOIN cm_info ci ON mc.id = ci.id WHERE ci.given_name = 'Tom' AND ci.surname = 'Cruise' ORDER BY m.length DESC")
if len(data) == 0:
  executor.output('No Tom Cruise films found')
else:
  executor.output(f'Longest Tom Cruise film is: {data[0]["title"]} with a length of {data[0]["length"]} minutes')
```
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===
No Tom Cruise films found
