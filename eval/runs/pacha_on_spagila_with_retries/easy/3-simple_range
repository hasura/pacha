=== QUERY PLAN ===
To provide more context to this conversation, I would need to retrieve the top ten largest payment values from the database.

```
data = executor.get_from_database("SELECT amount FROM paymant UNION ALL SELECT amount FROM payment_p2022_01 UNION ALL SELECT amount FROM payment_p2022_02 UNION ALL SELECT amount FROM payment_p2022_03 UNION ALL SELECT amount FROM payment_p2022_04 UNION ALL SELECT amount FROM payment_p2022_05 UNION ALL SELECT amount FROM payment_p2022_06 UNION ALL SELECT amount FROM payment_p2022_07 ORDER BY amount DESC LIMIT 10")
if len(data) == 0:
  executor.output('No payment records found')
else:
  executor.output('Top 10 largest payment values:')
  for i, row in enumerate(data, 1):
    executor.output(f'{i}. {row["amount"]}')
```
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===
Top 10 largest payment values:
1. 11.99
