=== INPUT ===
how many days can Cat Coneheads be checked out for?

=== OUTPUT ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
To answer this question, I need to retrieve the dueBackDuration from the Movie table where the title is 'Cat Coneheads'.

```
data = executor.get_from_database("SELECT dueBackDuration FROM default.Movie WHERE title = 'CAT CONEHEADS'")
if len(data) == 0:
  executor.output('Movie "Cat Coneheads" not found')
else:
  executor.output(f'Cat Coneheads can be checked out for {data[0]["dueBackDuration"]} days.')
```
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===
Cat Coneheads can be checked out for 5 days.
