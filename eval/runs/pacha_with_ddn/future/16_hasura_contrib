=== INPUT ===
What are the 5 worst rated Tom Cruise movies that I haven't seen?

=== OUTPUT ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
To provide the 5 worst rated Tom Cruise movies that the user hasn't seen, I would need to retrieve the following data from the database:

* A list of Tom Cruise movies (using the `MovieCm` table to link movies to cast members)
* The ratings of each movie (using the `Movie` table)
* A list of movies the user has already seen (assuming this information is stored in a table not shown in the schema, such as a `UserMovieHistory` table)

Here is the Python script to retrieve the required data:
```
# Get a list of Tom Cruise movies
tom_cruise_movies = executor.get_from_database("SELECT mc.filmId, m.title, m.rated FROM MovieCm mc JOIN Movie m ON mc.filmId = m.id WHERE mc.id = (SELECT id FROM Castmember WHERE givenName = 'Tom' AND surname = 'Cruise')")

# Assume the user's seen movies are stored in a UserMovieHistory table
user_seen_movies = executor.get_from_database("SELECT filmId FROM UserMovieHistory WHERE userId = ?")  # Replace ? with the user's ID

# Filter out movies the user has already seen
unseen_tom_cruise_movies = [movie for movie in tom_cruise_movies if movie['filmId'] not in [seen_movie['filmId'] for seen_movie in user_seen_movies]]

# Sort the movies by rating and get the 5 worst rated
worst_rated_movies = sorted(unseen_tom_cruise_movies, key=lambda x: x['rated'])[:5]

# Output the results
for movie in worst_rated_movies:
    executor.output(f"Title: {movie['title']}, Rating: {movie['rated']}")
```
Note: This script assumes the existence of a `UserMovieHistory` table, which is not present in the provided schema. The script would need to be modified to accommodate the actual table structure and user ID retrieval mechanism.
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===

Traceback (most recent call last):

=== RETRY ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
The error is due to the fact that the `UserMovieHistory` table does not exist in the provided database schema. Since we don't have a table to store the user's seen movies, we cannot filter out the movies the user has already seen.

Here is the modified script that only retrieves the 5 worst rated Tom Cruise movies:
```
# Get a list of Tom Cruise movies
tom_cruise_movies = executor.get_from_database("SELECT mc.filmId, m.title, m.rated FROM MovieCm mc JOIN Movie m ON mc.filmId = m.id WHERE mc.id = (SELECT id FROM Castmember WHERE givenName = 'Tom' AND surname = 'Cruise')")

# Sort the movies by rating and get the 5 worst rated
worst_rated_movies = sorted(tom_cruise_movies, key=lambda x: x['rated'])[:5]

# Output the results
for movie in worst_rated_movies:
    executor.output(f"Title: {movie['title']}, Rating: {movie['rated']}")
```
This script will retrieve all Tom Cruise movies, sort them by rating, and output the 5 worst rated ones.
