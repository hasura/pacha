To add context to this conversation, I need to retrieve the titles of French PG-13 movies from the database. 

```
data = executor.get_from_database("SELECT title FROM default.Movie WHERE languageId IN (SELECT languageId FROM default.Lang WHERE lang = 'French') AND rated = 'PG-13'")
if len(data) == 0:
  executor.output('No French PG-13 movies found')
else:
  executor.output('Titles of French PG-13 movies:')
  for movie in data:
    executor.output(f'{movie["title"]}')
```
