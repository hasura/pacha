=== INPUT ===
show me city/state/phone number for all the stores that have Core Suit in stock

=== OUTPUT ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
To add context to this conversation, I need to retrieve the store locations that have "Core Suit" in stock. 

```
data = executor.get_from_database("SELECT L.addr1, L.city, L.stateDistr, L.phoneNum FROM default.Catalog C JOIN default.Loc L ON C.storeId = L.id WHERE C.filmId IN (SELECT id FROM default.Movie WHERE title = 'CORE SUIT')")
if len(data) == 0:
  executor.output('No stores have Core Suit in stock')
else:
  for row in data:
    executor.output(f'Store at {row["addr1"]}, {row["city"]}, {row["stateDistr"]} with phone number {row["phoneNum"]} has Core Suit in stock')
```
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===

=== RETRY ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
The error is due to the fact that I'm trying to access the "city" field from the "Loc" table as "L.city", but the actual field name is "cityId". Here's the corrected script:

```
data = executor.get_from_database("SELECT L.addr1, M.city, L.stateDistr, L.phoneNum FROM default.Catalog C JOIN default.Loc L ON C.storeId = L.id JOIN default.Muni M ON L.cityId = M.id WHERE C.filmId IN (SELECT id FROM default.Movie WHERE title = 'CORE SUIT')")
if len(data) == 0:
  executor.output('No stores have Core Suit in stock')
else:
  for row in data:
    executor.output(f'Store at {row["addr1"]}, {row["city"]}, {row["stateDistr"]} with phone number {row["phoneNum"]} has Core Suit in stock')
```

In this corrected script, I'm joining the "Muni" table to get the city name from the "cityId" in the "Loc" table.
