=== INPUT ===
what's the average number of video rentals per customer across all stores

=== OUTPUT ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
To answer this question, we need to retrieve the total number of rentals and the total number of customers from the database. 

Here is the Python script to retrieve the required data:
```
rentals_data = executor.get_from_database("SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rentals FROM default.Trans")
customers_data = executor.get_from_database("SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_customers FROM default.Patron WHERE active = TRUE")

if len(rentals_data) == 0 or len(customers_data) == 0:
  executor.output('No data found')
else:
  total_rentals = rentals_data[0]["total_rentals"]
  total_customers = customers_data[0]["total_customers"]
  if total_customers == 0:
    executor.output('No active customers found')
  else:
    avg_rentals_per_customer = total_rentals / total_customers
    executor.output(f'Average number of video rentals per customer across all stores: {avg_rentals_per_customer}')
```
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===
Average number of video rentals per customer across all stores: 26.784641068447414
