=== QUERY PLAN ===
To add context to this conversation, I need to retrieve the full names of employees who handled a transaction along with the id of the rental transaction, for all rentals handled by an employee no longer working here.

Here is the Python script to retrieve the required data:
```
data = executor.get_from_database("SELECT t.id, CONCAT(te.firstName, ' ', te.lastName) AS employee_full_name FROM default.Trans t JOIN default.Team te ON t.staffId = te.id WHERE te.active = FALSE")
if len(data) == 0:
  executor.output('No inactive employees found who handled a transaction')
else:
  for row in data:
    executor.output(f'Rental transaction ID: {row["id"]}, handled by: {row["employee_full_name"]}')
```
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===
No inactive employees found who handled a transaction
