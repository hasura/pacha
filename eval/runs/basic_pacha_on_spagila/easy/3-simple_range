=== INPUT ===
top ten largest payment values

=== OUTPUT ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
To provide more context to the conversation, I need to retrieve the top ten largest payment values from the database.

Here is the Python script to retrieve the data:
```
data = executor.get_from_database("SELECT amount FROM paymant ORDER BY amount DESC LIMIT 10")
executor.output(f'Top 10 largest payment values: {data}')
executor.output('Query: SELECT amount FROM paymant ORDER BY amount DESC LIMIT 10')
```
This script retrieves the top 10 largest payment values from the `paymant` table, ordered in descending order, and outputs the results along with the query used to retrieve the data.
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===
Top 10 largest payment values: [{'amount': 11.99}, {'amount': 11.99}, {'amount': 11.99}, {'amount': 11.99}, {'amount': 11.99}, {'amount': 11.99}, {'amount': 11.99}, {'amount': 11.99}, {'amount': 11.99}, {'amount': 11.99}]
Query: SELECT amount FROM paymant ORDER BY amount DESC LIMIT 10
