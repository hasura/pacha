=== INPUT ===
which of my customers have birthdays this month

=== OUTPUT ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
To answer this question, I would need to retrieve the birthdates of the customers from the database. However, the provided database schema does not contain a column for storing customer birthdates. 

The `patron` table has columns for `create_date` and `updated`, but these are likely related to when the customer's account was created or last updated, rather than their birthdate.

Therefore, I would not be able to retrieve the necessary data to answer this question.
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===
