What is Titanic rated?

=== OUTPUT ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
To answer this question, I need to retrieve the rating of the movie "Titanic" from the database.

Here is the Python script to retrieve the data:
```
data = executor.get_from_database("SELECT rated FROM movie WHERE title = 'TITANIC'")
executor.output(f'Titanic is rated: {data[0]["rated"]}')
```
This script retrieves the rating of the movie "Titanic" from the "movie" table and outputs the result.
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 2, in <module>
TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable
