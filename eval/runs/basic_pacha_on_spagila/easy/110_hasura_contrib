=== INPUT ===
What is the longest Tom Cruise film?

=== OUTPUT ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
To answer this question, I need to retrieve data from the database. Specifically, I need to retrieve the films starring Tom Cruise and their corresponding lengths.

Here is the Python script to retrieve the required data:
```
data = executor.get_from_database("SELECT m.title, m.length FROM movie m JOIN movie_cm mc ON m.id = mc.film_id JOIN castmember cm ON mc.id = cm.id WHERE cm.given_name = 'Tom' AND cm.surname = 'Cruise' ORDER BY m.length DESC")
executor.output(f'Longest Tom Cruise film: {data[0]["title"]} with a length of {data[0]["length"]} minutes')
```
This script retrieves the titles and lengths of films starring Tom Cruise, orders them in descending order of length, and outputs the longest film.
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 2, in <module>
TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable
