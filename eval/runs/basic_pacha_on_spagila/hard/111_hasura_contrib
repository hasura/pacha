=== INPUT ===
Give me top N stores by revenue in a select time period (past 3 months or 12 months)

=== OUTPUT ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
To provide the top N stores by revenue in a select time period, I would need to retrieve data from the `payment` tables and the `franchise_unit` table. 

Here is the Python script to retrieve the required data:
```
data = executor.get_from_database("""
    SELECT fu.id, fu.address_id, SUM(p.amount) AS total_revenue
    FROM payment_p2022_03 p
    JOIN franchise_unit fu ON p.handled_by = fu.id
    WHERE p.payment_date >= NOW() - INTERVAL '3 months'
    GROUP BY fu.id, fu.address_id
    ORDER BY total_revenue DESC
    LIMIT N;
""")
executor.output(f'Top {N} stores by revenue in the past 3 months:\n{data}')
```
This script retrieves the total revenue for each store in the past 3 months, groups the results by store, and orders them by revenue in descending order. The `LIMIT N` clause is used to retrieve only the top N stores.

To retrieve data for the past 12 months, you can modify the `WHERE` clause to `WHERE p.payment_date >= NOW() - INTERVAL '12 months'`.

Note: You need to replace `N` with the desired number of top stores you want to retrieve.
