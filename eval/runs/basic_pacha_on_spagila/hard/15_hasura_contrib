=== INPUT ===
Suggest a children's' movie by popularity

=== OUTPUT ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
To suggest a popular children's movie, I would like to retrieve data from the database about the most rented or popular movies in the "movie" table, specifically those that are suitable for children.

Here is the Python script to retrieve the data:
```
data = executor.get_from_database("SELECT title, rated FROM movie WHERE rated IN ('G', 'PG') ORDER BY rental_duration DESC LIMIT 1")
executor.output(f"Popular children's movie: {data[0]['title']} (Rated {data[0]['rated']})")
```
This script retrieves the title and rating of the most rented movie (based on the "rental_duration" column) that has a rating of either 'G' or 'PG', which are suitable for children. The result is then output as a suggested popular children's movie.
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===
