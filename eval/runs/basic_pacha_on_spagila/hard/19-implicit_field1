=== INPUT ===
how many days can Cat Coneheads be checked out for?

=== QUERY PLAN ===
To answer this question, I need to retrieve the `due_back_duration` from the `movie` table where the `title` is 'Cat Coneheads'.

```
data = executor.get_from_database("SELECT due_back_duration FROM movie WHERE title = 'Cat Coneheads'")
executor.output(f"Cat Coneheads can be checked out for {data[0]['due_back_duration']} days.")
```
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 2, in <module>
TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable
