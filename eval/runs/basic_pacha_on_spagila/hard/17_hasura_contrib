=== INPUT ===
Which Tom Cruise DVDs contain extra footage of him bragging about doing his own stunts?

=== OUTPUT ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
To provide more context to this conversation, I would need to retrieve data from the database about Tom Cruise movies that have extra footage of him discussing his stunts. 

Here is the Python script to retrieve the relevant data:
```
data = executor.get_from_database("SELECT m.title, mc.special_features FROM movie m JOIN movie_cat mc ON m.id = mc.film_id WHERE m.title LIKE '%Tom Cruise%' AND mc.special_features LIKE '%Behind the Scenes%'")
executor.output(f'Tom Cruise movies with behind-the-scenes footage: {data}')
```
This script retrieves the titles of Tom Cruise movies that have special features containing behind-the-scenes footage, which may include him discussing his stunts.
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===
Traceback (most recent call last):

HINT:  Perhaps you meant to reference the column "m.special_features".
