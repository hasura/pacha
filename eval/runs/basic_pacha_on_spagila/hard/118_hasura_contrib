=== OUTPUT ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
To answer this question, I would need to retrieve sales data for each store over the last 6 months. 

Here is the Python script to retrieve the required data:
```
data = executor.get_from_database("SELECT store_id, SUM(amount) as total_sales, DATE_TRUNC('month', payment_date) as month \
                                  FROM payment_p2022_01 \
                                  UNION ALL \
                                  SELECT store_id, SUM(amount) as total_sales, DATE_TRUNC('month', payment_date) as month \
                                  FROM payment_p2022_02 \
                                  UNION ALL \
                                  SELECT store_id, SUM(amount) as total_sales, DATE_TRUNC('month', payment_date) as month \
                                  FROM payment_p2022_03 \
                                  UNION ALL \
                                  SELECT store_id, SUM(amount) as total_sales, DATE_TRUNC('month', payment_date) as month \
                                  FROM payment_p2022_04 \
                                  UNION ALL \
                                  SELECT store_id, SUM(amount) as total_sales, DATE_TRUNC('month', payment_date) as month \
                                  FROM payment_p2022_05 \
                                  UNION ALL \
                                  SELECT store_id, SUM(amount) as total_sales, DATE_TRUNC('month', payment_date) as month \
                                  FROM payment_p2022_06 \
                                  UNION ALL \
                                  SELECT store_id, SUM(amount) as total_sales, DATE_TRUNC('month', payment_date) as month \
                                  FROM payment_p2022_07 \
                                  WHERE payment_date >= NOW() - INTERVAL '6 months' \
                                  GROUP BY store_id, month \
                                  ORDER BY store_id, month")

executor.output("Store Sales Data:")
for row in data:
    executor.output(f"Store ID: {row['store_id']}, Month: {row['month']}, Total Sales: {row['total_sales']}")
```
This script retrieves the total sales for each store for each month over the last 6 months. The data is grouped by store ID and month, and ordered by store ID and month.
