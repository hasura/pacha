=== INPUT ===
Give me a trend of stores by their efficiency over last 12 months (calculate the efficiency weekly for each store and then plot for me to get an idea which stores are improving efficiency)

=== OUTPUT ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
To provide a trend of stores by their efficiency over the last 12 months, I would need to retrieve data from the database that can help calculate the efficiency of each store on a weekly basis. 

Based on the provided database schema, I would need to retrieve the following data:

1. Rental transactions: This can be obtained from the `trans` table, which contains information about customer transactions (rentals).
2. Store information: This can be obtained from the `franchise_unit` table, which contains information about each store location.
3. Inventory information: This can be obtained from the `catalog` table, which contains information about the inventory of copies.

Here is a Python script to retrieve the necessary data:
```
# Retrieve rental transactions for the last 12 months
rental_transactions = executor.get_from_database("""
    SELECT 
        fu.id AS store_id, 
        DATE_TRUNC('week', t.rental_date) AS rental_week, 
        COUNT(t.id) AS num_rentals
    FROM 
        trans t 
    JOIN 
        franchise_unit fu ON t.staff_id = fu.id 
    WHERE 
        t.rental_date >= NOW() - INTERVAL '12 months'
    GROUP BY 
        fu.id, 
        DATE_TRUNC('week', t.rental_date)
    ORDER BY 
        fu.id, 
        rental_week
""")

# Retrieve store information
stores = executor.get_from_database("SELECT id, address_id FROM franchise_unit")

# Retrieve inventory information
inventory = executor.get_from_database("SELECT store_id, COUNT(id) AS num_copies FROM catalog GROUP BY store_id")

# Output the data
executor.output("Rental Transactions:")
for row in rental_transactions:
    executor.output(f"Store ID: {row['store_id']}, Rental Week: {row['rental_week']}, Number of Rentals: {row['num_rentals']}")

executor.output("\nStores:")
for row in stores:
    executor.output(f"Store ID: {row['id']}, Address ID: {row['address_id']}")

executor.output("\nInventory:")
for row in inventory:
    executor.output(f"Store ID: {row['store_id']}, Number of Copies: {row['num_copies']}")
```
This script retrieves the necessary data to calculate the efficiency of each store on a weekly basis. The efficiency can be calculated by dividing the number of rentals by the number of copies available in the inventory. The output will provide a trend of stores by their efficiency
