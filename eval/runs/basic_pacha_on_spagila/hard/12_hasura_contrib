Best performing regions

=== QUERY PLAN ===
To provide more context to the conversation, I need to retrieve data on the best performing regions. 

I will retrieve the total sales by store from the "sales_by_store" table. This data will help identify the regions with the highest sales.

Here is the Python script to retrieve the data:
```
data = executor.get_from_database("SELECT * FROM sales_by_store ORDER BY total_sales DESC")
executor.output("Total Sales by Store:\n" + str(data))
```
This script retrieves all rows from the "sales_by_store" table, ordered by total sales in descending order. The output will show the store with the highest total sales at the top.
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===
Total Sales by Store:
[{'store': 'Hamilton,New Zealand', 'manager': "Lavone O'Reilly", 'total_sales': 33726.77}, {'store': 'Boksburg,South Africa', 'manager': 'Warner Hudson', 'total_sales': 33689.74}]
