=== INPUT ===
"Stack rank all the stores by their efficiency (efficiency = DVD rented/ DVD inventory

=== OUTPUT ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
To stack rank all the stores by their efficiency, we need to retrieve the number of DVDs rented and the total DVD inventory for each store. 

Here is the Python script to retrieve the required data:

```
data = executor.get_from_database("""
    SELECT 
        fu.id AS store_id, 
        fu.address_id, 
        COUNT(t.inventory_id) AS dvd_rented, 
        (SELECT COUNT(catalog.inventory_id) FROM catalog WHERE catalog.store_id = fu.id) AS dvd_inventory,
        COUNT(t.inventory_id) / (SELECT COUNT(catalog.inventory_id) FROM catalog WHERE catalog.store_id = fu.id) AS efficiency
    FROM 
        franchise_unit fu 
    LEFT JOIN 
        catalog ON fu.id = catalog.store_id 
    LEFT JOIN 
        trans t ON catalog.inventory_id = t.inventory_id 
    GROUP BY 
        fu.id, fu.address_id 
    ORDER BY 
        efficiency DESC
""")

executor.output(f"Store Efficiency Ranking:\n{data}")
```

This script will output a list of stores with their efficiency ranking, along with the number of DVDs rented and the total DVD inventory for each store. The efficiency is calculated as the number of DVDs rented divided by the total DVD inventory. The stores are ranked in descending order of their efficiency.
