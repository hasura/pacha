Which is the closest video shop to my parent's house at postcode <blah>?

=== OUTPUT ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
To answer this question, I would need to retrieve the location of the user's parent's house based on the provided postcode and then find the closest video shop (franchise_unit) to that location.

Here is the Python script to retrieve the required data:
```
postcode = "<blah>"  # Replace with the actual postcode
data = executor.get_from_database(f"SELECT * FROM loc WHERE zip = '{postcode}'")
executor.output(f"Location of parent's house: {data[0]['addr1']}, {data[0]['city']}, {data[0]['state_distr']}, {data[0]['zip']}")

closest_video_shop_query = f"""
    SELECT fu.address_id, l.addr1, l.city, l.state_distr, l.zip
    FROM franchise_unit fu
    JOIN loc l ON fu.address_id = l.id
    ORDER BY (l.zip = '{postcode}') DESC, ABS(l.zip - '{postcode}') LIMIT 1
"""
data = executor.get_from_database(closest_video_shop_query)
executor.output(f"Closest video shop: {data[0]['addr1']}, {data[0]['city']}, {data[0]['state_distr']}, {data[0]['zip']}")
```
This script first retrieves the location of the user's parent's house based on the provided postcode. Then, it finds the closest video shop by joining the `franchise_unit` and `loc` tables, ordering by the postcode match and the absolute difference in postcodes, and limiting the result to the top 1 closest video shop.
