=== INPUT ===
Movies liked by people who liked similar movies as me

=== OUTPUT ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
To provide more context to this conversation, I need to retrieve data from the user's database. Specifically, I need to know the movies liked by the user and the movies liked by people who liked similar movies as the user.

Here is the Python script to retrieve the required data:
```
# Get the user's liked movies
user_liked_movies = executor.get_from_database("SELECT m.title FROM movie m JOIN trans t ON m.id = t.inventory_id WHERE t.customer_id = <user_id>")

# Get the movies liked by people who liked similar movies as the user
similar_movies = executor.get_from_database("""
    SELECT m.title 
    FROM movie m 
    JOIN trans t ON m.id = t.inventory_id 
    JOIN (
        SELECT customer_id 
        FROM trans 
        WHERE inventory_id IN ({}) 
        GROUP BY customer_id 
        HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT inventory_id) > 1
    ) similar_customers ON t.customer_id = similar_customers.customer_id
    WHERE m.id NOT IN ({})
""".format(','.join(str(movie['id']) for movie in user_liked_movies), ','.join(str(movie['id']) for movie in user_liked_movies)))

executor.output("User's liked movies: " + ', '.join(movie['title'] for movie in user_liked_movies))
executor.output("Movies liked by people who liked similar movies as the user: " + ', '.join(movie['title'] for movie in similar_movies))
```
This script assumes that the user's ID is available as `<user_id>`. The first query retrieves the movies liked by the user, and the second query retrieves the movies liked by people who liked similar movies as the user. The results are then outputted as a list of movie titles.
