=== INPUT ===
What are the 5 worst rated Tom Cruise movies that I haven't seen?

=== OUTPUT ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
To answer this question, I would need to retrieve data from the database about Tom Cruise movies and their ratings. 

I would need to retrieve the following data:

- A list of movies starring Tom Cruise
- The ratings of each of these movies
- A list of movies the user has already seen

Here is a Python script to retrieve this data:

```
# Retrieve a list of movies starring Tom Cruise
tom_cruise_movies = executor.get_from_database("SELECT * FROM movie WHERE id IN (SELECT film_id FROM movie_cm WHERE id IN (SELECT id FROM castmember WHERE given_name = 'Tom' AND surname = 'Cruise'))")

# Retrieve the ratings of each of these movies
movie_ratings = executor.get_from_database("SELECT * FROM movie_list WHERE fid IN (SELECT id FROM movie WHERE id IN (SELECT film_id FROM movie_cm WHERE id IN (SELECT id FROM castmember WHERE given_name = 'Tom' AND surname = 'Cruise')))")

# Assume the user's seen movies are stored in a table called 'user_seen_movies'
user_seen_movies = executor.get_from_database("SELECT * FROM user_seen_movies")

# Process the data to get the 5 worst rated Tom Cruise movies the user hasn't seen
worst_rated_movies = []
for movie in tom_cruise_movies:
    if movie['id'] not in [seen_movie['movie_id'] for seen_movie in user_seen_movies]:
        for rating in movie_ratings:
            if rating['fid'] == movie['id']:
                worst_rated_movies.append({'title': movie['title'], 'rating': rating['rating']})
                break

worst_rated_movies.sort(key=lambda x: x['rating'])
executor.output("The 5 worst rated Tom Cruise movies you haven't seen are:")
for movie in worst_rated_movies[:5]:
    executor.output(f"{movie['title']} - Rating: {movie['rating']}")
```

This script assumes that the user's seen movies are stored in a table called 'user_seen_movies' and that the ratings are stored in the 'ovie_list' table. The actual table and column names may vary depending on the database schema.
