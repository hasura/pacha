=== QUERY PLAN ===
To provide the required information, I need to retrieve data from the database. 

I need to retrieve the city, state, and phone number of all stores that have "Core Suit" in stock. 

Here is the Python script to retrieve the required data:
```
data = executor.get_from_database("SELECT l.city, l.state_distr, l.phone_num, c.store_id \
                                  FROM catalog c \
                                  JOIN loc l ON c.store_id = l.id \
                                  WHERE c.film_id IN (SELECT m.id FROM movie m WHERE m.title = 'Core Suit')")
executor.output(f'City, State, Phone Number, Store ID: {data}')
executor.output('Description: This query retrieves the city, state, and phone number of all stores that have "Core Suit" in stock.')
executor.output('Query: SELECT l.city, l.state_distr, l.phone_num, c.store_id FROM catalog c JOIN loc l ON c.store_id = l.id WHERE c.film_id IN (SELECT m.id FROM movie m WHERE m.title = \'Core Suit\')')
```
