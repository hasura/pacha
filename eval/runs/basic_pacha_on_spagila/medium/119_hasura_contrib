=== INPUT ===
what's the average number of video rentals per customer across all stores

=== OUTPUT ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
To answer this question, we need to retrieve the total number of video rentals and the total number of customers across all stores. 

Here is the Python script to retrieve the required data:
```
rental_count = executor.get_from_database("SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rentals FROM trans")
customer_count = executor.get_from_database("SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS total_customers FROM trans")

executor.output(f'Total Rentals: {rental_count[0]["total_rentals"]}')
executor.output(f'Total Customers: {customer_count[0]["total_customers"]}')
executor.output(f'Average Rentals per Customer: {rental_count[0]["total_rentals"] / customer_count[0]["total_customers"]:.2f}')
```
This script retrieves the total number of rentals and the total number of unique customers from the `trans` table, and then calculates and outputs the average number of rentals per customer.
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===
Total Rentals: 16044
Total Customers: 599
Average Rentals per Customer: 26.78
