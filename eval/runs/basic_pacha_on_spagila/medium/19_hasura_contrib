Has Tom Cruise done any films in Spanish?

=== OUTPUT ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
To add context to this conversation, I would like to retrieve data from the database about Tom Cruise's filmography, specifically looking for films where the language is Spanish.

```
data = executor.get_from_database("SELECT m.title, l.lang FROM movie m JOIN movie_list ml ON m.id = ml.fid JOIN lang l ON m.language_id = l.language_id WHERE ml.actors LIKE '%Tom Cruise%' AND l.lang = 'Spanish'")
executor.output(f'Tom Cruise has done the following films in Spanish: {", ".join([row["title"] for row in data])}')
```
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===
