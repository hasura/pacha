Show me titles of all the french PG13 movies (dubbed into french is fine)

=== OUTPUT ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
To add context to this conversation, I need to retrieve data from the user's database. Specifically, I need to retrieve the titles of French PG13 movies, including those dubbed into French.

Here is the Python script to retrieve the required data:
```
data = executor.get_from_database("SELECT m.title FROM movie m JOIN lang l ON m.language_id = l.language_id WHERE l.lang = 'French' AND m.rated = 'PG-13' UNION SELECT m.title FROM movie m JOIN lang l ON m.language_orig = l.language_id WHERE l.lang = 'French' AND m.rated = 'PG-13'")
executor.output(f'French PG13 Movie Titles: {", ".join([row["title"] for row in data])}')
```
This script retrieves the titles of movies that are either originally in French or dubbed into French and have a PG-13 rating. The results are then output as a comma-separated list of movie titles.
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===
French PG13 Movie Titles: OCTOBER SUBMARINE, FRONTIER CABIN, DIVIDE MONSTER, WANDA CHAMBER, DYNAMITE TARZAN, SADDLE ANTITRUST, KICK SAVANNAH, LEBOWSKI SOLDIERS, HALF OUTFIELD, MILLION ACE, HOLIDAY GAMES, LOST BIRD, BLADE POLISH, POSEIDON FOREVER, SLIPPER FIDELITY, LUCKY FLYING, KWAI HOMEWARD, TELEMARK HEARTBREAKERS, SPEED SUIT, MADRE GABLES, RUGRATS SHAKESPEARE
