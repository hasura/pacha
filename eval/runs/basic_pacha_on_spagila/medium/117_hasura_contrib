=== INPUT ===
who are my top 5 renters for each of my stores

=== OUTPUT ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
To provide the top 5 renters for each store, I need to retrieve data from the database. 

I will need to retrieve the following data:
- A list of all stores
- For each store, a list of the top 5 customers who have rented the most items, along with the number of items they have rented

Here is the Python script to retrieve this data:
```
stores = executor.get_from_database("SELECT id, address_id FROM franchise_unit")
for store in stores:
    store_id = store['id']
    top_renters = executor.get_from_database(f"""
        SELECT p.id, p.surname, p.given_name, COUNT(t.id) as num_rentals
        FROM patron p
        JOIN trans t ON p.id = t.customer_id
        JOIN catalog c ON t.inventory_id = c.inventory_id
        WHERE c.store_id = {store_id}
        GROUP BY p.id, p.surname, p.given_name
        ORDER BY num_rentals DESC
        LIMIT 5
    """)
    executor.output(f"Top 5 renters for store {store_id}:")
    for renter in top_renters:
        executor.output(f"{renter['surname']} {renter['given_name']}: {renter['num_rentals']} rentals")
```
This script will output the top 5 renters for each store, along with the number of items they have rented.
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===
Top 5 renters for store 0:
