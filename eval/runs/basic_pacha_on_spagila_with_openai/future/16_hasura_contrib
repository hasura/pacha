=== INPUT ===
What are the 5 worst rated Tom Cruise movies that I haven't seen?

=== OUTPUT ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
To answer the user's question, we would need to retrieve data from the `movie` table to get the ratings of Tom Cruise movies, and data from the `trans` table to see which movies the user has already seen.

We would need to retrieve the following columns from the `movie` table:
- `title`: The title of the movie
- `rated`: The rating of the movie
- `id`: The unique identifier of the movie

And the following columns from the `trans` table:
- `customer_id`: The ID of the customer (to identify the user)
- `inventory_id`: The ID of the movie that the user has already seen

We can then filter out the Tom Cruise movies and find the 5 worst rated movies that the user hasn't seen.

Here is the Python script to retrieve the relevant data:
```python
# Retrieve the IDs of the movies the user has already seen
seen_movies = executor.get_from_database("SELECT inventory_id FROM trans WHERE customer_id = <user_id>")
seen_movie_ids = [movie["inventory_id"] for movie in seen_movies]

# Retrieve the titles, ratings, and IDs of Tom Cruise movies that the user hasn't seen
tom_cruise_movies = executor.get_from_database("SELECT title, rated, id FROM movie WHERE title LIKE '%Tom Cruise%' AND id NOT IN %s ORDER BY rated ASC LIMIT 5" % str(tuple(seen_movie_ids)))

for movie in tom_cruise_movies:
    executor.output(f'Title: {movie["title"]}, Rating: {movie["rated"]}')
```
Please note that `<user_id>` should be replaced with the actual ID of the user in the `trans` table.
