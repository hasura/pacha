=== INPUT ===
which of my stores is trending downwards in sales over the last 6 months and which ones are trending up

=== OUTPUT ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
To answer the user's question, we would need to retrieve data on the sales trends of the stores over the last 6 months. We can retrieve this data from the "sales_by_store" table which contains information about total sales by store.

We would need to compare the total sales of each store for the last 6 months to determine which stores are trending downwards and which ones are trending up.

Here is the Python script to retrieve the relevant data:

```
# Retrieve data for total sales by store for the last 6 months
data = executor.get_from_database("SELECT * FROM sales_by_store")

# Output the data retrieved
for row in data:
    executor.output(f'Store: {row["store"]}, Total Sales: {row["total_sales"]}')
```

This script will retrieve the total sales data for each store from the "sales_by_store" table, allowing us to analyze the sales trends and identify which stores are trending downwards and which ones are trending up.
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===
Store: Hamilton,New Zealand, Total Sales: 33726.77
Store: Boksburg,South Africa, Total Sales: 33689.74
