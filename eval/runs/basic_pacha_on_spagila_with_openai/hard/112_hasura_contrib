=== INPUT ===
"Give me top N stores by revenue by DVD category (Comedy

=== OUTPUT ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
To provide the user with the top N stores by revenue by DVD category (Comedy), we would need to retrieve data from the database tables "sales_by_cat" and "sales_by_store". Specifically, we would need to query the total sales for the Comedy category from the "sales_by_cat" table and then join this data with the store information from the "sales_by_store" table to get the revenue by store for the Comedy category.

Here is the Python script to retrieve this data:

```
data = executor.get_from_database("SELECT sbs.total_sales, sbsc.category, sbs.store FROM sales_by_store sbs JOIN sales_by_cat sbsc ON sbsc.category = 'Comedy' AND sbsc.category = sbs.category ORDER BY sbs.total_sales DESC LIMIT N")
for row in data:
    executor.output(f'Store: {row["store"]}, Total Sales: {row["total_sales"]}, Category: {row["category"]}')
```

Please replace N in the SQL query with the desired number of top stores you want to retrieve by revenue for the Comedy category.
