=== INPUT ===
Suggest a children's' movie by popularity

=== OUTPUT ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
To suggest a children's movie by popularity, we would need to retrieve data from the database related to movies that are categorized as children's movies and are popular based on some criteria like ratings or sales.

We can retrieve data from the `movie` table and `movie_cat` table to find children's movies and their categories. Additionally, we can look at the `sales_by_cat` table to determine the popularity of movies based on sales.

Here is the Python script to retrieve the relevant data:

```
# Retrieve data for children's movies
children_movies_data = executor.get_from_database("SELECT m.title, m.release_year, m.rate, m.length, m.logline, c.name AS category \
                                                    FROM movie m \
                                                    JOIN movie_cat mc ON m.id = mc.film_id \
                                                    JOIN cat c ON mc.category_id = c.id \
                                                    WHERE c.name = 'Children'")

# Output the data retrieved
for row in children_movies_data:
    executor.output(f'Title: {row["title"]}')
    executor.output(f'Release Year: {row["release_year"]}')
    executor.output(f'Rating: {row["rate"]}')
    executor.output(f'Length: {row["length"]} minutes')
    executor.output(f'Logline: {row["logline"]}')
    executor.output(f'Category: {row["category"]}')
```

This script will retrieve and output information about children's movies from the database, including the title, release year, rating, length, logline, and category of each movie.
