=== INPUT ===
Give me top N stores by revenue in a select time period (past 3 months or 12 months)

=== OUTPUT ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
To provide the user with the top N stores by revenue in a selected time period, we would need to retrieve data from the database related to sales by store. Specifically, we would need to query the "sales_by_store" table to get the total sales for each store within the specified time period.

We can retrieve this data by querying the "sales_by_store" table and filtering the results based on the time period specified by the user. The query would involve selecting the total sales, store name, and manager from the "sales_by_store" table.

Here is the Python script to retrieve the top N stores by revenue in the past 12 months:

```
data = executor.get_from_database("SELECT * FROM sales_by_store WHERE EXTRACT(MONTH FROM CURRENT_DATE) - EXTRACT(MONTH FROM payment_date) <= 12 ORDER BY total_sales DESC LIMIT N")
for row in data:
    executor.output(f'Store: {row["store"]}, Manager: {row["manager"]}, Total Sales: {row["total_sales"]}')
```

In the script above, replace `N` with the desired number of top stores to display. This query will retrieve the top N stores by revenue in the past 12 months and output the store name, manager, and total sales for each store.
