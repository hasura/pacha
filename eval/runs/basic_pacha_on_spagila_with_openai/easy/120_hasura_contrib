=== INPUT ===
which of my customers have birthdays this month

=== OUTPUT ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
To answer the user's question about which customers have birthdays this month, we would need to retrieve data from the `patron` table which contains information about all customers. Specifically, we would need to retrieve the `given_name`, `surname`, and `email_addr` columns from the `patron` table to identify the customers.

Here is the Python script to retrieve the relevant data:

```
import datetime

# Get the current month and year
current_month = datetime.datetime.now().month
current_year = datetime.datetime.now().year

# Retrieve data from the database
data = executor.get_from_database(f"SELECT given_name, surname, email_addr FROM patron WHERE EXTRACT(MONTH FROM create_date) = {current_month} AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM create_date) = {current_year}")

# Output the retrieved data
for row in data:
    executor.output(f'Customer: {row["given_name"]} {row["surname"]} - Email: {row["email_addr"]}')
```
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===
