=== INPUT ===
top ten largest payment values

=== OUTPUT ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
To provide the user with the top ten largest payment values, we would need to retrieve data from the `paymant` table which contains information about each payment made by a customer.

We can query the `amount` column in the `paymant` table and sort the results in descending order to get the top ten largest payment values.

Here is the Python script to retrieve and output the top ten largest payment values:

```
data = executor.get_from_database("SELECT amount FROM paymant ORDER BY amount DESC LIMIT 10")

for index, row in enumerate(data, start=1):
    executor.output(f'{index}. Payment Value: {row["amount"]}')
```
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===
1. Payment Value: 11.99
2. Payment Value: 11.99
3. Payment Value: 11.99
4. Payment Value: 11.99
5. Payment Value: 11.99
6. Payment Value: 11.99
7. Payment Value: 11.99
8. Payment Value: 11.99
9. Payment Value: 11.99
10. Payment Value: 11.99
