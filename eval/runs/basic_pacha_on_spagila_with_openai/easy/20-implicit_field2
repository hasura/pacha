=== INPUT ===
What is Titanic rated?

=== OUTPUT ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
To answer the user's question about the rating of the movie "Titanic", we would need to retrieve data from the `movie` table where the `title` is 'TITANIC'. Specifically, we would need to retrieve the `rated` column which contains the rating information.

```python
data = executor.get_from_database("SELECT rated FROM movie WHERE title = 'TITANIC'")
if data:
    executor.output(f'Titanic is rated: {data[0]["rated"]}')
else:
    executor.output("Sorry, the rating for Titanic is not available in the database.")
```
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===
Sorry, the rating for Titanic is not available in the database.
