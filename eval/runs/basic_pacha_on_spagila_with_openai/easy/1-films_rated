=== INPUT ===
what are our films rated pg? just names is fine

=== OUTPUT ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
To answer the user's question about films rated PG, we would need to retrieve the film titles from the `movie` table where the `rated` column is equal to 'PG'.

We can retrieve this data using the following SQL query:
```sql
SELECT title
FROM movie
WHERE rated = 'PG'
```

I will now write a Python script to retrieve and output the film titles that are rated PG.
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===
