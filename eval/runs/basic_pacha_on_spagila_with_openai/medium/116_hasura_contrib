what was the most frequently rented movie for each of the stores in the last month

=== OUTPUT ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
To answer the user's question about the most frequently rented movie for each store in the last month, we would need to retrieve data on the rentals made in the last month for each store. Specifically, we would need to retrieve the movie title and the count of rentals for each movie at each store.

```python
# Retrieve the most frequently rented movie for each store in the last month
data = executor.get_from_database("""
SELECT m.title AS movie_title, COUNT(*) AS rental_count, c.store AS store_name
FROM trans t
JOIN catalog c ON t.inventory_id = c.inventory_id
JOIN movie m ON c.film_id = m.id
WHERE t.rental_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 month'
GROUP BY m.title, c.store
ORDER BY c.store, COUNT(*) DESC
""")
for row in data:
    executor.output(f'Movie Title: {row["movie_title"]}, Rental Count: {row["rental_count"]}, Store Name: {row["store_name"]}')
```

=== EXECUTION RESULT ===
