=== QUERY PLAN ===
To answer the user's question, we need to retrieve the full names of employees who handled a transaction along with the rental transaction ID for all rentals handled by an employee who is no longer working at the company.

We can retrieve this information by querying the following tables:
- `trans` table to get the rental transactions information.
- `team` table to get the full names of employees.
- We will join these two tables on the `staff_id` column in the `trans` table and the `id` column in the `team` table.

Here is the Python script to retrieve the required data:

```
data = executor.get_from_database("SELECT t.id AS rental_transaction_id, CONCAT(tl.first_name, ' ', tl.last_name) AS employee_full_name \
                                    FROM trans t \
                                    JOIN team tl ON t.staff_id = tl.id \
                                    WHERE tl.active = FALSE")

for row in data:
    executor.output(f'Rental Transaction ID: {row["rental_transaction_id"]}, Employee Full Name: {row["employee_full_name"]}')
```
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===
