=== INPUT ===
Show me titles of all the french PG13 movies (dubbed into french is fine)

=== OUTPUT ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
To answer the user's question, we would need to retrieve data from the following tables:
1. movie: To get the titles of movies.
2. lang: To filter movies that are in French.
3. movie_list: To filter movies that are rated as PG-13.

We can retrieve the movie titles meeting the user's criteria by querying the database with a SQL query that joins these tables based on the required conditions.

```python
data = executor.get_from_database("SELECT m.title \
                                    FROM movie m \
                                    JOIN lang l ON m.language_id = l.language_id \
                                    JOIN movie_list ml ON m.id = ml.fid \
                                    WHERE l.lang = 'French' AND m.rated = 'PG-13'")
for row in data:
    executor.output(f'Title: {row["title"]}')
```
