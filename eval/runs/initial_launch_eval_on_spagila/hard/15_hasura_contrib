=== QUERY PLAN ===
I need to retrieve the top-rated children's movies from the database to suggest a popular one. 

```
data = executor.get_from_database("SELECT title, rated FROM default.Movie WHERE rated IN ('G', 'PG') ORDER BY rate DESC LIMIT 1")
if len(data) == 0:
  executor.output('No children\'s movies found')
else:
  executor.output(f'Top-rated children\'s movie: {data[0]["title"]} (Rated {data[0]["rated"]})')
```
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===
Top-rated children's movie: ACE GOLDFINGER (Rated G)
