=== INPUT ===
Which Tom Cruise DVDs contain extra footage of him bragging about doing his own stunts?

=== OUTPUT ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
To add context to this conversation, I need to retrieve data from the database that could provide information about Tom Cruise movies with extra footage of him doing his own stunts.

```
data = executor.get_from_database("SELECT m.title, mc.categoryId FROM default.Movie m JOIN default.MovieCat mc ON m.id = mc.filmId WHERE m.title LIKE '%Tom Cruise%'")
if len(data) > 0:
    executor.output('Relevant Tom Cruise movies:')
    for movie in data:
        executor.output(f'Title: {movie["title"]}, Category ID: {movie["categoryId"]}')
else:
    executor.output('No Tom Cruise movies found')
```
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===
No Tom Cruise movies found
