=== INPUT ===
Give me a trend of stores by their efficiency over last 12 months (calculate the efficiency weekly for each store and then plot for me to get an idea which stores are improving efficiency)

=== OUTPUT ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
To provide a trend of stores by their efficiency over the last 12 months, I would need to retrieve data on the total sales and total rentals for each store on a weekly basis. 

Here is the Python script to retrieve the required data:
```
data = executor.get_from_database("""
    SELECT 
        DATE_TRUNC('week', t.rentalDate) AS week, 
        f.id AS store_id, 
        SUM(p.amount) AS total_sales
    FROM 
        Trans t 
    JOIN 
        FranchiseUnit f ON t.staffId = f.id 
    JOIN 
        Paymant p ON t.id = p.rentalId 
    WHERE 
        t.rentalDate > NOW() - INTERVAL '12 months' 
    GROUP BY 
        week, store_id 
    ORDER BY 
        week, store_id
""")

if len(data) == 0:
    executor.output('No data found for the last 12 months')
else:
    executor.output('Weekly total sales by store for the last 12 months:')
    for row in data:
        executor.output(f'Week: {row["week"]}, Store ID: {row["store_id"]}, Total Sales: {row["total_sales"]}')
```
This script will retrieve the total sales for each store on a weekly basis for the last 12 months. The `DATE_TRUNC` function is used to truncate the `rentalDate` to the nearest week. The results are then grouped by week and store ID, and ordered by week and store ID.

To calculate the efficiency of each store, we would need to define what efficiency means in this context. One possible definition could be the total sales per rental. If that's the case, we would need to retrieve the total rentals for each store on a weekly basis as well. Here is the updated Python script:
```
data = executor.get_from_database("""
    SELECT 
        DATE_TRUNC('week', t.rentalDate) AS week, 
        f.id AS store_id, 
        SUM(p.amount) AS total_sales, 
        COUNT(t.id) AS total_rentals
    FROM 
        Trans t 
    JOIN 
        FranchiseUnit f ON t.staffId = f.id 
    JOIN 
        Paymant p ON t.id = p.rentalId 
    WHERE 
        t.rentalDate > NOW() - INTERVAL '12 months' 
    GROUP BY 
        week, store_id 
    ORDER BY 
        week, store_id
""")

if len(data) == 0:
    executor.output('No data found for the last 12 months')
else:
    executor.output('Weekly total sales and total rentals by store for the last 12 months:')
    for row in data:
        if row["total_rentals"] == 0:
            efficiency = 0
        else:
            efficiency = row["total_sales"] / row["total_rentals"]
        executor.output(f'Week: {row["week"]}, Store ID: {row["store_id"]}, Total Sales: {row["total_sales"]}, Total Rentals: {row["total_rentals"]}, Efficiency: {efficiency}')
```
This script will retrieve the total sales and total rentals for each store on a weekly basis for the last 12 months. The efficiency is then calculated as the total sales per rental.
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===
No data found for the last 12 months
