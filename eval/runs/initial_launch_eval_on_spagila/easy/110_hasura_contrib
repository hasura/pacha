What is the longest Tom Cruise film?

=== OUTPUT ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
To answer this question, I need to retrieve data from the database. Specifically, I need to find the longest film starring Tom Cruise.

```
data = executor.get_from_database("SELECT m.title, m.length FROM default.Movie m JOIN default.MovieCm mc ON m.id = mc.filmId JOIN default.Castmember c ON mc.id = c.id WHERE c.givenName = 'Tom' AND c.surname = 'Cruise' ORDER BY m.length DESC LIMIT 1")
if len(data) == 0:
  executor.output('No Tom Cruise films found')
else:
  executor.output(f'The longest Tom Cruise film is {data[0]["title"]} with a length of {data[0]["length"]} minutes')
```
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===
No Tom Cruise films found
