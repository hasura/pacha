=== OUTPUT ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
To add context to this conversation, I need to retrieve a list of PG-rated movie titles from the database.

```
data = executor.get_from_database("SELECT title FROM default.Movie WHERE rated = 'PG'")
if len(data) == 0:
  executor.output('No PG-rated movies found')
else:
  pg_movies = [movie["title"] for movie in data]
  executor.output(f'PG-rated movies: {", ".join(pg_movies)}')
```
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===
