what movies are being rented the most?

=== OUTPUT ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
To provide more context to this conversation, I would like to retrieve the top 5 most rented movies from the database.

```
data = executor.get_from_database("SELECT m.title, COUNT(t.inventoryId) AS rental_count FROM default.Trans t JOIN default.Movie m ON t.inventoryId = m.id GROUP BY m.title ORDER BY rental_count DESC LIMIT 5")
if len(data) == 0:
  executor.output('No rental data found')
else:
  executor.output('Top 5 most rented movies:')
  for i, movie in enumerate(data):
    executor.output(f'{i+1}. {movie["title"]} - Rented {movie["rental_count"]} times')
```
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===
Top 5 most rented movies:
1. AGENT TRUMAN - Rented 5 times
2. ALICE FANTASIA - Rented 5 times
3. DATE SPEED - Rented 5 times
4. ALONE TRIP - Rented 5 times
5. ACE GOLDFINGER - Rented 5 times
