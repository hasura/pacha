=== QUERY PLAN ===
To answer this question, I need to retrieve the customer who has spent the most money on rentals from the database.

```
data = executor.get_from_database("SELECT customerId, SUM(amount) AS total_spent FROM default.Paymant GROUP BY customerId ORDER BY total_spent DESC LIMIT 1")
if len(data) == 0:
  executor.output('No customers found')
else:
  customer_id = data[0]["customerId"]
  total_spent = data[0]["total_spent"]
  executor.output(f'Customer with ID {customer_id} has spent the most money on rentals: ${total_spent}')
```
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===
Customer with ID 526 has spent the most money on rentals: $221.55000000000013
