"Given my recent viewing history

=== OUTPUT ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
Based on the conversation, it seems like the user is about to ask for a recommendation or discuss their viewing history. To add context to the conversation, I would retrieve the user's recent viewing history from the database.

Here is the Python script to retrieve the data:
```
data = executor.get_from_database("SELECT m.title, t.rentalDate FROM default.Trans t JOIN default.Movie m ON t.inventoryId = m.id WHERE t.customerId = (SELECT id FROM default.Patron WHERE emailAddr = '<user_email>') ORDER BY t.rentalDate DESC LIMIT 5")
if len(data) == 0:
  executor.output('No recent viewing history found')
else:
  executor.output('Recent viewing history:')
  for movie in data:
    executor.output(f'{movie["title"]} - Rented on {movie["rentalDate"]}')
```
This script retrieves the titles of the movies the user has rented recently, along with the rental dates, and outputs them in a readable format.
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===
No recent viewing history found
