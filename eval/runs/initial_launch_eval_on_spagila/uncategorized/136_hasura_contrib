=== INPUT ===
What's the average rating of movies in the Action genre? What is the average rating by Genre?

=== OUTPUT ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
To answer this question, I need to retrieve the average rating of movies in the Action genre and the average rating by Genre from the database.

```
# Retrieve the average rating of movies in the Action genre
data = executor.get_from_database("SELECT AVG(rated) AS avg_rating FROM default.Movie m JOIN default.MovieCat mc ON m.id = mc.filmId JOIN default.Cat c ON mc.categoryId = c.id WHERE c.name = 'Action'")
if len(data) > 0 and data[0]['avg_rating'] is not None:
  executor.output(f'Average rating of movies in the Action genre: {data[0]["avg_rating"]}')
else:
  executor.output('No movies found in the Action genre')

# Retrieve the average rating by Genre
data = executor.get_from_database("SELECT c.name AS genre, AVG(m.rated) AS avg_rating FROM default.Movie m JOIN default.MovieCat mc ON m.id = mc.filmId JOIN default.Cat c ON mc.categoryId = c.id GROUP BY c.name")
if len(data) > 0:
  for row in data:
    if row['avg_rating'] is not None:
      executor.output(f'Average rating of movies in the {row["genre"]} genre: {row["avg_rating"]}')
    else:
      executor.output(f'No movies found in the {row["genre"]} genre')
else:
  executor.output('No movies found in any genre')
```

=== QUERY PLAN ===
The error is due to the `AVG` function not being able to handle the `rated` column which is of type `TEXT`. The `AVG` function can only be used with numeric types. 

Since the `rated` column contains ratings like 'G', 'PG', 'PG-13', 'R', 'NC-17', we can't calculate the average rating directly. Instead, we can count the number of movies for each rating and output the distribution of ratings.

Here's the corrected script:

```
# Retrieve the distribution of ratings for movies in the Action genre
data = executor.get_from_database("SELECT rated, COUNT(*) AS count FROM default.Movie m JOIN default.MovieCat mc ON m.id = mc.filmId JOIN default.Cat c ON mc.categoryId = c.id WHERE c.name = 'Action' GROUP BY rated")
if len(data) > 0:
  for row in data:
    executor.output(f'Number of movies in the Action genre with rating {row["rated"]}: {row["count"]}')
else:
  executor.output('No movies found in the Action genre')

# Retrieve the distribution of ratings by Genre
data = executor.get_from_database("SELECT c.name AS genre, m.rated, COUNT(*) AS count FROM default.Movie m JOIN default.MovieCat mc ON m.id = mc.filmId JOIN default.Cat c ON mc.categoryId = c.id GROUP BY c.name, m.rated")
if len(data) > 0:
  for row in data:
    executor.output(f'Number of movies in the {row["genre"]} genre with rating {row["rated"]}: {row["count"]}')
else:
  executor.output('No movies found in any genre')
