=== INPUT ===
How much did I make in subscriptions vs late fees over the last month?

=== OUTPUT ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
To provide more context to this conversation, I need to retrieve data from the database. Specifically, I need to retrieve the total amount of subscription payments and late fees paid by the user over the last month.

```
subscription_payments = executor.get_from_database("SELECT SUM(amount) AS total_subscriptions FROM default.PaymentP202207 WHERE customerId = (SELECT id FROM default.Patron WHERE emailAddr = '<user_email>') AND paymentDate >= DATE_TRUNC('month', CURRENT_DATE) - INTERVAL '1 month'")
late_fees = executor.get_from_database("SELECT SUM(amount) AS total_late_fees FROM default.Paymant WHERE customerId = (SELECT id FROM default.Patron WHERE emailAddr = '<user_email>') AND paymentDate >= DATE_TRUNC('month', CURRENT_DATE) - INTERVAL '1 month' AND rentalId IS NOT NULL")

if len(subscription_payments) == 0 or len(late_fees) == 0:
  executor.output('No payment data found for the user over the last month')
else:
  executor.output(f'Total subscription payments over the last month: {subscription_payments[0]["total_subscriptions"]}')
  executor.output(f'Total late fees over the last month: {late_fees[0]["total_late_fees"]}')
```
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===
Total subscription payments over the last month: None
Total late fees over the last month: None
