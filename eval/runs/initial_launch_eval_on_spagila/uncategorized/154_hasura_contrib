Query that gives me list of stores by number of rentals

=== OUTPUT ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
To provide more context to this conversation, I need to retrieve the list of stores with their corresponding number of rentals. 

```
data = executor.get_from_database("SELECT s.id, COUNT(t.inventoryId) AS num_rentals FROM default.Trans t JOIN default.FranchiseUnit s ON t.staffId = s.id GROUP BY s.id ORDER BY num_rentals DESC")
if len(data) == 0:
  executor.output('No rental data found')
else:
  for row in data:
    executor.output(f'Store {row["id"]} has {row["num_rentals"]} rentals')
```
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===
Store 1 has 8040 rentals
Store 2 has 8004 rentals
