=== INPUT ===
What is the most rented movie that Emily Blunt has been in?

=== OUTPUT ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
To answer this question, I need to retrieve data from the database. Specifically, I need to find the movie that Emily Blunt has been in and has the highest number of rentals.

```
# Get the ID of Emily Blunt from the Castmember table
emily_blunt_id = executor.get_from_database("SELECT id FROM default.Castmember WHERE givenName = 'Emily' AND surname = 'Blunt'")

if len(emily_blunt_id) == 0:
  executor.output('Emily Blunt not found in the database')
else:
  emily_blunt_id = emily_blunt_id[0]['id']

  # Get the movie IDs that Emily Blunt has been in from the MovieCm table
  movie_ids = executor.get_from_database("SELECT filmId FROM default.MovieCm WHERE id = " + str(emily_blunt_id))

  if len(movie_ids) == 0:
    executor.output('Emily Blunt has not been in any movies in the database')
  else:
    movie_ids = [movie['filmId'] for movie in movie_ids]

    # Get the rental count for each movie from the Trans table
    rental_counts = []
    for movie_id in movie_ids:
      rental_count = executor.get_from_database("SELECT COUNT(*) AS rental_count FROM default.Trans WHERE inventoryId IN (SELECT inventoryId FROM default.Catalog WHERE filmId = " + str(movie_id) + ")")
      rental_counts.append({'movie_id': movie_id, 'rental_count': rental_count[0]['rental_count']})

    # Find the movie with the highest rental count
    most_rented_movie = max(rental_counts, key=lambda x: x['rental_count'])

    # Get the title of the most rented movie from the Movie table
    most_rented_movie_title = executor.get_from_database("SELECT title FROM default.Movie WHERE id = " + str(most_rented_movie['movie_id']))

    if len(most_rented_movie_title) == 0:
      executor.output('Most rented movie not found in the database')
    else:
      executor.output(f'The most rented movie that Emily Blunt has been in is: {most_rented_movie_title[0]["title"]} with {most_rented_movie["rental_count"]} rentals')
```
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===
Emily Blunt not found in the database
