=== QUERY PLAN ===
To add context to this conversation, I need to retrieve the top customers who have made the most number of purchases in the last month.

```
data = executor.get_from_database("SELECT p.customerId, COUNT(p.id) AS num_purchases FROM default.PaymentP202207 p GROUP BY p.customerId ORDER BY num_purchases DESC LIMIT 10")
if len(data) == 0:
  executor.output('No customers found with purchases in the last month')
else:
  for row in data:
    executor.output(f'Customer ID {row["customerId"]} made {row["num_purchases"]} purchases in the last month')
```
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===
Customer ID 221 made 11 purchases in the last month
Customer ID 526 made 10 purchases in the last month
