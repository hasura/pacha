=== QUERY PLAN ===
To provide more context to this conversation, I would like to retrieve data on the least rented movies from the database.

```
data = executor.get_from_database("SELECT m.title, COUNT(t.inventoryId) AS rental_count FROM default.Movie m LEFT JOIN default.Trans t ON m.id = t.inventoryId GROUP BY m.title ORDER BY rental_count LIMIT 10")
if len(data) == 0:
  executor.output('No rental data found')
else:
  executor.output('Least rented movies:')
  for movie in data:
    executor.output(f'{movie["title"]}: {movie["rental_count"]} rentals')
```
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===
Least rented movies:
AFRICAN EGG: 0 rentals
BEAST HUNCHBACK: 2 rentals
CROSSING DIVORCE: 2 rentals
SADDLE ANTITRUST: 2 rentals
VANILLA DAY: 2 rentals
