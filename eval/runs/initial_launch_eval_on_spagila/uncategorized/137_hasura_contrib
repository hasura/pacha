What is the average duration of movies by Genre?

=== OUTPUT ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
To provide more context to this conversation, I would like to retrieve the average duration of movies by genre from the database.

```
data = executor.get_from_database("SELECT mc.name, AVG(m.length) AS avg_length FROM default.Movie m JOIN default.MovieCat mc ON m.id = mc.filmId GROUP BY mc.name")
if len(data) > 0:
    for row in data:
        executor.output(f'Average duration of movies in {row["name"]} genre is {row["avg_length"]} minutes')
else:
    executor.output('No movie data found')
```
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===

=== RETRY ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
The error is due to the fact that the column name in the `MovieCat` table is `categoryId`, not `name`. We need to join the `MovieCat` table with the `Cat` table to get the category name. Here's the corrected script:

```
data = executor.get_from_database("SELECT c.name, AVG(m.length) AS avg_length FROM default.Movie m JOIN default.MovieCat mc ON m.id = mc.filmId JOIN default.Cat c ON mc.categoryId = c.id GROUP BY c.name")
if len(data) > 0:
    for row in data:
        executor.output(f'Average duration of movies in {row["name"]} genre is {row["avg_length"]} minutes')
else:
    executor.output('No movie data found')
```
