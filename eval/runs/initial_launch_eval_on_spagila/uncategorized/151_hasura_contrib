"Apart from english

=== OUTPUT ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
It seems like the user is asking about languages apart from English. 

To add context to this conversation, I would need to retrieve a list of languages from the database.

```
data = executor.get_from_database("SELECT lang FROM default.Lang")
if len(data) == 0:
  executor.output('No languages found')
else:
  languages = [row["lang"] for row in data]
  executor.output(f'Languages apart from English: {", ".join(languages)}')
```
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===
Languages apart from English: English, Italian, Japanese, Mandarin, French, German
