```
data = executor.get_from_database("SELECT m.title FROM default.Movie m JOIN default.MovieCm mc ON m.id = mc.filmId JOIN default.Castmember c ON mc.id = c.id WHERE c.givenName = 'Nicolas' AND c.surname = 'Cage' AND m.id IN (SELECT mc.filmId FROM default.MovieCm mc JOIN default.Castmember c ON mc.id = c.id WHERE c.givenName = 'Keanu' AND c.surname = 'Reeves')")
if len(data) == 0:
  executor.output('No movies found starring both Nicolas Cage and Keanu Reeves')
else:
  executor.output('Movies starring both Nicolas Cage and Keanu Reeves:')
  for movie in data:
    executor.output(f'- {movie["title"]}')
```
