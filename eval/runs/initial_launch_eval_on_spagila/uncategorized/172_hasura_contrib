=== INPUT ===
Get all app_movies where movieCms.castmember.givenName is Emily and movieCms.castmember.surname is Blunt

=== OUTPUT ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
To add context to this conversation, I need to retrieve the list of movies that feature Emily Blunt as a cast member.

```
data = executor.get_from_database("SELECT m.title FROM default.Movie m JOIN default.MovieCm mc ON m.id = mc.filmId JOIN default.Castmember cm ON mc.id = cm.id WHERE cm.givenName = 'Emily' AND cm.surname = 'Blunt'")
if len(data) == 0:
  executor.output('No movies found with Emily Blunt as a cast member')
else:
  executor.output('Movies featuring Emily Blunt:')
  for movie in data:
    executor.output(f'- {movie["title"]}')
```
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===
No movies found with Emily Blunt as a cast member
