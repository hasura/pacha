=== INPUT ===
What is each staff members most frequently sold genre?

=== OUTPUT ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
To answer this question, we need to retrieve data on each staff member's sales by genre. 

```
data = executor.get_from_database("""
    SELECT t.username, mc.name, COUNT(mc.name) as count
    FROM default.Trans t
    JOIN default.Catalog c ON t.inventoryId = c.inventoryId
    JOIN default.Movie m ON c.filmId = m.id
    JOIN default.MovieCat mc ON m.id = mc.filmId
    JOIN default.Team te ON t.staffId = te.id
    GROUP BY t.staffId, mc.name, te.username
    ORDER BY count DESC
""")
if len(data) == 0:
  executor.output('No sales data found')
else:
  for row in data:
    executor.output(f'Staff member {row["username"]} most frequently sold genre is {row["name"]} with {row["count"]} sales')
```
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
The error is due to the fact that the table alias `t` is used to refer to the `Trans` table, but the column `username` is actually in the `Team` table, which is aliased as `te`. Here is the corrected script:

```
data = executor.get_from_database("""
    SELECT te.username, mc.name, COUNT(mc.name) as count
    FROM default.Trans t
    JOIN default.Catalog c ON t.inventoryId = c.inventoryId
    JOIN default.Movie m ON c.filmId = m.id
    JOIN default.MovieCat mc ON m.id = mc.filmId
    JOIN default.Team te ON t.staffId = te.id
    GROUP BY te.username, mc.name
    ORDER BY count DESC
""")
if len(data) == 0:
  executor.output('No sales data found')
else:
  for row in data:
    executor.output(f'Staff member {row["username"]} most frequently sold genre is {row["name"]} with {row["count"]} sales')
```

The error is due to the fact that the column `name` is not in the `MovieCat` table, it's in the `Cat` table. Here is the corrected script:

```
data = executor.get_from_database("""

    FROM default.Trans t
    JOIN default.Catalog c ON t.inventoryId = c.inventoryId
