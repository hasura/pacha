=== INPUT ===
What is the most cosmopolitan country based on movie languages and their rental volume

=== OUTPUT ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
To answer this question, we need to retrieve data on the languages of movies and their rental volume. 

We need to retrieve the languages of movies, the countries where these movies were rented, and the volume of rentals for each country. 

Here is the Python script to retrieve the required data:
```
data = executor.get_from_database("""
    SELECT l.lang, c.country, COUNT(t.inventoryId) AS rental_volume
    FROM default.Trans t
    JOIN default.Movie m ON t.inventoryId = m.id
    JOIN default.Lang l ON m.languageId = l.languageId
    JOIN default.FranchiseUnit fu ON t.staffId = fu.id
    JOIN default.Loc loc ON fu.addressId = loc.id
    JOIN default.Muni muni ON loc.cityId = muni.id
    JOIN default.Country c ON muni.countryId = c.id
    GROUP BY l.lang, c.country
    ORDER BY rental_volume DESC
""")

if len(data) == 0:
    executor.output('No data found')
else:
    executor.output('Most cosmopolitan country based on movie languages and their rental volume:')
    for row in data:
        executor.output(f'Language: {row["lang"]}, Country: {row["country"]}, Rental Volume: {row["rental_volume"]}')
```
