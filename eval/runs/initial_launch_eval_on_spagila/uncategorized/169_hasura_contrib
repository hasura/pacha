=== INPUT ===
which country has the most active movie rentals business

=== OUTPUT ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
To answer this question, I would need to retrieve the count of active rentals by country. 

```
data = executor.get_from_database("SELECT c.country, COUNT(t.id) AS rental_count FROM default.Trans t JOIN default.Patron p ON t.customerId = p.id JOIN default.Loc l ON p.addressId = l.id JOIN default.Muni m ON l.cityId = m.id JOIN default.Country c ON m.countryId = c.id WHERE p.active = TRUE GROUP BY c.country ORDER BY rental_count DESC")
if len(data) == 0:
  executor.output('No active rentals found')
else:
  executor.output(f'Country with the most active movie rentals is: {data[0]["country"]} with {data[0]["rental_count"]} rentals')
```
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===
Country with the most active movie rentals is: India with 1572 rentals
