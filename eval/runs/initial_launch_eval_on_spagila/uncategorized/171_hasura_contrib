=== INPUT ===
Find me all movies that Emily Blunt has been in

=== OUTPUT ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
To add context to this conversation, I need to retrieve data from the database about Emily Blunt's filmography. 

```
data = executor.get_from_database("SELECT m.title FROM default.Movie m JOIN default.MovieCm mc ON m.id = mc.filmId JOIN default.Castmember c ON mc.id = c.id WHERE c.givenName = 'Emily' AND c.surname = 'Blunt'")
if len(data) == 0:
  executor.output('No movies found with Emily Blunt')
else:
  executor.output('Movies featuring Emily Blunt:')
  for movie in data:
    executor.output(f'- {movie["title"]}')
```
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===
No movies found with Emily Blunt
