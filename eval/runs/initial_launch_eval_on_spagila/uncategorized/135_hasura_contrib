"I like 5 actors

=== OUTPUT ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
Based on the conversation, it seems like the user is interested in actors. To add context to the conversation, I would like to retrieve a list of the 5 actors the user likes.

Here is the Python script to retrieve the data:
```
data = executor.get_from_database("SELECT * FROM CmInfo WHERE givenName IN (SELECT givenName FROM CmInfo LIMIT 5)")
if len(data) == 0:
  executor.output('No actors found')
else:
  executor.output('Top 5 actors:')
  for actor in data:
    executor.output(f'Name: {actor["givenName"]} {actor["surname"]}, ID: {actor["id"]}')
```
This script retrieves the top 5 actors from the CmInfo table, along with their names and IDs.
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===
Top 5 actors:
Name: PENELOPE GUINESS, ID: 1
Name: NICK WAHLBERG, ID: 2
Name: ED CHASE, ID: 3
