what genre of films are rented by customers in the age range of 18 to 25

=== QUERY PLAN ===
To add context to this conversation, I need to retrieve data on the most popular film genres among customers in the 18-25 age range.

```
data = executor.get_from_database("SELECT mc.name, COUNT(mc.name) AS count FROM default.Trans t "
                                 "JOIN default.Patron p ON t.customerId = p.id "
                                 "JOIN default.Catalog c ON t.inventoryId = c.inventoryId "
                                 "JOIN default.Movie m ON c.filmId = m.id "
                                 "JOIN default.MovieCat mc ON m.id = mc.filmId "
                                 "WHERE p.createDate BETWEEN DATE_TRUNC('year', CURRENT_DATE) - 25 AND DATE_TRUNC('year', CURRENT_DATE) - 18 "
                                 "GROUP BY mc.name "
                                 "ORDER BY count DESC")

if len(data) == 0:
  executor.output('No data found for customers in the 18-25 age range')
else:
  executor.output('Most popular film genres among customers in the 18-25 age range:')
  for row in data:
    executor.output(f'{row["name"]}: {row["count"]} rentals')
```

The error is due to the fact that the `mc.name` field is not recognized. This is because the `MovieCat` table does not have a `name` field. Instead, the `name` field is in the `Cat` table. We need to join the `MovieCat` table with the `Cat` table to get the category name.

Here is the corrected script:

```
data = executor.get_from_database("SELECT c.name, COUNT(c.name) AS count FROM default.Trans t "
                                 "JOIN default.Patron p ON t.customerId = p.id "
                                 "JOIN default.Catalog c2 ON t.inventoryId = c2.inventoryId "
                                 "JOIN default.Movie m ON c2.filmId = m.id "
                                 "JOIN default.MovieCat mc ON m.id = mc.filmId "
                                 "JOIN default.Cat c ON mc.categoryId = c.id "
                                 "WHERE p.createDate BETWEEN DATE_TRUNC('year', CURRENT_DATE) - 25 AND DATE_TRUNC('year', CURRENT_DATE) - 18 "
                                 "GROUP BY c.name "
                                 "ORDER BY count DESC")

if len(data) == 0:
  executor.output('No data found for customers in the 18-25 age range')
else:
  executor.output('Most popular film genres among customers in the 18-25 age range:')
  for row in data:

The error is due to the fact that the `DATE_TRUNC` function is not being used correctly. The `DATE_TRUNC` function is used to truncate a date or timestamp to a specific level of precision, but it cannot be used to subtract a number of years from a date.

To fix this, we can use the `AGE` function to calculate the age of the customer, and then filter based on that. Here is the corrected script:

```
data = executor.get_from_database("SELECT c.name, COUNT(c.name) AS count FROM default.Trans t "
                                 "JOIN default.Patron p ON t.customerId = p.id "
                                 "JOIN default.Catalog c2 ON t.inventoryId = c2.inventoryId "
                                 "JOIN default.Movie m ON c2.filmId = m.id "
                                 "JOIN default.MovieCat mc ON m.id = mc.filmId "
                                 "JOIN default.Cat c ON mc.categoryId = c.id "
                                 "WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM AGE(CURRENT_DATE, p.createDate)) BETWEEN 18 AND 25 "
                                 "GROUP BY c.name "
                                 "ORDER BY count DESC")

if len(data) == 0:
  executor.output('No data found for customers in the 18-25 age range')
else:
  executor.output('Most popular film genres among customers in the 18-25 age range:')
  for row in data:
    executor.output(f'{row["name"]}: {row["count"]} rentals')
```

This script uses the `AGE` function to calculate the age of the customer, and then filters the results to only include customers between 18 and 25 years old.

Did you mean 'abs'?

The error is due to the fact that the `AGE` function is not a valid function in the database. The `AGE` function is a PostgreSQL-specific function, and it seems that the database being used does not support it.

To fix this, we can use a different approach to calculate the age of the customer. We can use the `DATE_PART` function to extract the year from the current date and the customer's creation date, and then subtract the two years to get the age.

Here is the corrected script:

```
data = executor.get_from_database("SELECT c.name, COUNT(c.name) AS count FROM default.Trans t "
                                 "JOIN default.Patron p ON t.customerId = p.id "
                                 "JOIN default.Catalog c2 ON t.inventoryId = c2.inventoryId "
                                 "JOIN default.Movie m ON c2.filmId = m.id "
                                 "JOIN default.MovieCat mc ON m.id = mc.filmId "
                                 "JOIN default.Cat c ON mc.categoryId = c.id "
                                 "WHERE DATE_PART('year', CURRENT_DATE) - DATE_PART('year', p.createDate) BETWEEN 18 AND 25 "
                                 "GROUP BY c.name "
                                 "ORDER BY count DESC")

if len(data) == 0:
  executor.output('No data found for customers in the 18-25 age range')
else:
  executor.output('Most popular film genres among customers in the 18-25 age range:')
  for row in data:
    executor.output(f'{row["name"]}: {row["count"]} rentals')
```
