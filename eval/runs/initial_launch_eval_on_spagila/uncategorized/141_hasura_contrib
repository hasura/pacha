=== INPUT ===
Are we missing either a key genre of movie based on customer interests

=== OUTPUT ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
To add context to this conversation, I think it would be useful to retrieve data on the most popular movie genres among customers. This could help identify if there are any key genres missing from the catalog.

```
data = executor.get_from_database("SELECT category, COUNT(*) AS count FROM MovieCat JOIN Movie ON MovieCat.filmId = Movie.id GROUP BY category ORDER BY count DESC")
if len(data) == 0:
  executor.output('No movie categories found')
else:
  executor.output('Most popular movie genres:')
  for row in data:
    executor.output(f'{row["category"]}: {row["count"]} movies')
```
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===

pacha.data_engine.ddn.DdnDataEngineException: error in data fusion: Schema error: No field named category. Valid fields are "MovieCat"."categoryId", "MovieCat"."filmId", "MovieCat".updated, "Movie"."dueBackDuration", "Movie".id, "Movie"."languageId", "Movie"."languageOrig", "Movie".length, "Movie".logline, "Movie".rate, "Movie".rated, "Movie"."releaseYear", "Movie".replacement, "Movie".title, "Movie".updated.

=== RETRY ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
The error is due to the fact that the `category` field is not directly available in the `MovieCat` or `Movie` tables. Instead, we need to join the `MovieCat` table with the `Cat` table to get the category name.

Here's the corrected script:

```
data = executor.get_from_database("SELECT C.name AS category, COUNT(*) AS count FROM MovieCat JOIN Movie ON MovieCat.filmId = Movie.id JOIN Cat C ON MovieCat.categoryId = C.id GROUP BY C.name ORDER BY count DESC")
if len(data) == 0:
  executor.output('No movie categories found')
else:
  executor.output('Most popular movie genres:')
  for row in data:
    executor.output(f'{row["category"]}: {row["count"]} movies')
```
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===
Most popular movie genres:
Drama: 152 movies
Music: 152 movies
Travel: 151 movies
Children: 150 movies
