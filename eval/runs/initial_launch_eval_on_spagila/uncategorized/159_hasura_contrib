=== INPUT ===
Find the number of staff in a particular store

=== OUTPUT ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
To add context to this conversation, I need to retrieve the number of staff members in a particular store. 

```
data = executor.get_from_database("SELECT COUNT(*) AS staff_count FROM default.Team WHERE storeId = (SELECT id FROM default.FranchiseUnit WHERE addressId = (SELECT id FROM default.Loc WHERE city = 'CityName' AND stateDistr = 'StateName'))")
if len(data) == 0:
  executor.output('No store found with the given city and state')
else:
  staff_count = data[0].get("staff_count")
  if staff_count:
    executor.output(f'There are {staff_count} staff members in the store located in CityName, StateName')
  else:
    executor.output('No staff members found in the store located in CityName, StateName')
```

Please replace 'CityName' and 'StateName' with the actual city and state of the store.
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===

pacha.data_engine.ddn.DdnDataEngineException: error in data fusion: Schema error: No field named city. Valid fields are default."Loc".addr1, default."Loc".addr2, default."Loc"."cityId", default."Loc".id, default."Loc"."phoneNum", default."Loc"."stateDistr", default."Loc".updated, default."Loc".zip.

=== RETRY ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
The error is due to the fact that the "Loc" table does not have a "city" field. Instead, it has a "cityId" field, which is a foreign key referencing the "Muni" table, where the actual city name is stored. Here's the corrected script:

```
data = executor.get_from_database("SELECT COUNT(*) AS staff_count FROM default.Team WHERE storeId = (SELECT id FROM default.FranchiseUnit WHERE addressId = (SELECT id FROM default.Loc WHERE cityId = (SELECT id FROM default.Muni WHERE city = 'CityName'))) AND storeId IN (SELECT id FROM default.FranchiseUnit WHERE addressId = (SELECT id FROM default.Loc WHERE stateDistr = 'StateName'))")
if len(data) == 0:
  executor.output('No store found with the given city and state')
else:
  staff_count = data[0].get("staff_count")
  if staff_count:
    executor.output(f'There are {staff_count} staff members in the store located in CityName, StateName')
  else:
    executor.output('No staff members found in the store located in CityName, StateName')
```

Please replace 'CityName' and 'StateName' with the actual city and state of the store.
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===
No staff members found in the store located in CityName, StateName
