=== INPUT ===
Which of my staff members have sold the most rentals?

=== OUTPUT ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
To answer this question, I need to retrieve data from the database that shows the total sales of each staff member. 

```
data = executor.get_from_database("SELECT t.username, SUM(p.amount) AS totalSales FROM default.Paymant p JOIN default.Team t ON p.handledBy = t.id GROUP BY t.username ORDER BY totalSales DESC")
if len(data) == 0:
  executor.output('No sales data found')
else:
  for row in data:
    executor.output(f'Staff member {row["username"]} has sold {row["totalSales"]} worth of rentals')
```
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===
Staff member gaston.wuckert has sold 33927.040000004876 worth of rentals
Staff member fay.kub has sold 33489.47000000525 worth of rentals
