=== INPUT ===
Which stores have the greatest customer turnover?

=== OUTPUT ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
To answer this question, we need to retrieve the stores with the highest number of customers. We can do this by counting the number of customers associated with each store.

```
data = executor.get_from_database("SELECT storeId, COUNT(id) AS customer_count FROM default.Patron GROUP BY storeId ORDER BY customer_count DESC")
if len(data) == 0:
  executor.output('No customers found')
else:
  for row in data:
    executor.output(f'Store {row["storeId"]} has {row["customer_count"]} customers')
```
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===
Store 1 has 326 customers
Store 2 has 273 customers
