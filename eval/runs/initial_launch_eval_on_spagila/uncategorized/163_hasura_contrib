=== QUERY PLAN ===
To provide more context to the conversation, I need to retrieve data on the total sales for each film category.

```
data = executor.get_from_database("SELECT category, totalSales FROM default.SalesByCat")
if len(data) == 0:
  executor.output('No sales data found')
else:
  for row in data:
    executor.output(f'Total sales for {row["category"]}: {row["totalSales"]}')
```
