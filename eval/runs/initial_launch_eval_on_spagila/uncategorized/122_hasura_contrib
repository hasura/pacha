=== INPUT ===
Top 50 customers by number of videos rented and by amount of money spent

=== OUTPUT ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
To provide more context to this conversation, I need to retrieve data from the database that shows the top 50 customers by the number of videos rented and by the amount of money spent.

```
data_rentals = executor.get_from_database("SELECT p.id, COUNT(t.id) AS num_rentals FROM Patron p JOIN Trans t ON p.id = t.customerId GROUP BY p.id ORDER BY num_rentals DESC LIMIT 50")
data_spent = executor.get_from_database("SELECT p.id, SUM(pa.amount) AS total_spent FROM Patron p JOIN Paymant pa ON p.id = pa.customerId GROUP BY p.id ORDER BY total_spent DESC LIMIT 50")

if len(data_rentals) == 0:
  executor.output('No customers have rented any videos')
else:
  executor.output('Top 50 customers by number of videos rented:')
  for row in data_rentals:
    executor.output(f'Customer ID: {row["id"]}, Number of rentals: {row["num_rentals"]}')

if len(data_spent) == 0:
  executor.output('No customers have spent any money')
else:
  executor.output('Top 50 customers by amount of money spent:')
  for row in data_spent:
    executor.output(f'Customer ID: {row["id"]}, Total spent: {row["total_spent"]}')
```
