=== INPUT ===
name and log lines for movies where the latter contains 'girl'

=== OUTPUT ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
To add context to this conversation, I need to retrieve data from the database that contains movie titles and log lines where the log line contains the word 'girl'.

```
data = executor.get_from_database("SELECT title, logline FROM default.Movie WHERE logline ILIKE '%girl%'")
if len(data) == 0:
  executor.output('No movies found with log lines containing the word "girl"')
else:
  for movie in data:
    executor.output(f'Title: {movie["title"]}, Log line: {movie["logline"]}')
```
