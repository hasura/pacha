=== QUERY PLAN ===
To add context to this conversation, I need to retrieve the store ID of deactivated customers from the database.

```
data = executor.get_from_database("SELECT storeId FROM default.Patron WHERE active = FALSE")
if len(data) == 0:
  executor.output('No deactivated customers found')
else:
  for row in data:
    executor.output(f'Store ID of deactivated customer: {row["storeId"]}')
```
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===
No deactivated customers found
