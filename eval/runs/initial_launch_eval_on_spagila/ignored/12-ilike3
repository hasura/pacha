=== QUERY PLAN ===
To add context to this conversation, I need to retrieve a list of last names of actors and cast members that start with 'Mc' from the database.

```
data = executor.get_from_database("SELECT surname FROM default.Castmember WHERE surname LIKE 'Mc%'")
if len(data) == 0:
  executor.output('No cast members with last name starting with "Mc" found')
else:
  executor.output('Last names of cast members starting with "Mc":')
  for row in data:
    executor.output(f'- {row["surname"]}')
```
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===
No cast members with last name starting with "Mc" found
