=== INPUT ===
Show me titles of all the french PG13 movies (dubbed into french is fine)

=== OUTPUT ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
To add context to this conversation, I need to retrieve the titles of French PG-13 movies from the database. 

```
data = executor.get_from_database("SELECT title FROM default.Movie WHERE rated = 'PG-13' AND (languageId IN (SELECT languageId FROM default.Lang WHERE lang = 'French') OR languageOrig IN (SELECT languageId FROM default.Lang WHERE lang = 'French'))")
if len(data) == 0:
  executor.output('No French PG-13 movies found')
else:
  executor.output('Titles of French PG-13 movies:')
  for movie in data:
    executor.output(f'Title: {movie["title"]}')
```
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===

=== RETRY ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
The error is due to the subquery in the WHERE clause. The database engine does not support this type of logical expression. We can rewrite the query to use JOINs instead of subqueries. Here's the corrected script:

```
data = executor.get_from_database("SELECT M.title FROM default.Movie M JOIN default.Lang L ON M.languageId = L.languageId WHERE M.rated = 'PG-13' AND L.lang = 'French' UNION SELECT M.title FROM default.Movie M JOIN default.Lang L ON M.languageOrig = L.languageId WHERE M.rated = 'PG-13' AND L.lang = 'French'")
if len(data) == 0:
  executor.output('No French PG-13 movies found')
else:
  executor.output('Titles of French PG-13 movies:')
  for movie in data:
    executor.output(f'Title: {movie["title"]}')
```
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===

Title: BLADE POLISH
Title: DIVIDE MONSTER
Title: DYNAMITE TARZAN
Title: FRONTIER CABIN
Title: HALF OUTFIELD
Title: HOLIDAY GAMES
