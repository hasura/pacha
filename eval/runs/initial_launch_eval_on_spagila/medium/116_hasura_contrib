=== INPUT ===
what was the most frequently rented movie for each of the stores in the last month

=== OUTPUT ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
To answer this question, we need to retrieve the most frequently rented movie for each store in the last month. 

We can do this by joining the `Trans` table (which contains rental information) with the `Catalog` table (which contains inventory information) and the `Movie` table (which contains movie information). We'll also need to filter the results to only include rentals from the last month.

Here's the Python script to retrieve the data:
```
data = executor.get_from_database("""
    SELECT s.id AS store_id, m.title, COUNT(t.id) AS rental_count
    FROM Trans t
    JOIN Catalog c ON t.inventoryId = c.inventoryId
    JOIN Movie m ON c.filmId = m.id
    JOIN FranchiseUnit s ON c.storeId = s.id
    WHERE t.rentalDate > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 month'
    GROUP BY s.id, m.title
    ORDER BY s.id, rental_count DESC
""")
if len(data) == 0:
    executor.output('No rental data found for the last month')
else:
    for row in data:
        executor.output(f'Store {row["store_id"]}: Most frequently rented movie is {row["title"]} with {row["rental_count"]} rentals')
```
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===
No rental data found for the last month
