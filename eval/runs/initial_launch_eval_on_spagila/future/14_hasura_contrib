=== INPUT ===
Movies liked by people who liked similar movies as me

=== OUTPUT ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
To provide more context to this conversation, I would like to retrieve the user's movie preferences from the database. Specifically, I would like to retrieve the movie IDs of the movies the user has liked or rented in the past.

Here is the Python script to retrieve this data:
```
data = executor.get_from_database("SELECT filmId FROM default.Trans WHERE customerId = (SELECT id FROM default.Patron WHERE emailAddr = '<user_email>')")
if len(data) == 0:
  executor.output('No movie preferences found for this user')
else:
  liked_movies = [row["filmId"] for row in data]
  executor.output(f'Movies liked by this user: {liked_movies}')
```
This script assumes that the user's email address is available and can be used to identify their ID in the `Patron` table. The script then retrieves the movie IDs from the `Trans` table where the customer ID matches the user's ID.
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 1, in <module>

pacha.data_engine.ddn.DdnDataEngineException: error in data fusion: Schema error: No field named "filmId". Valid fields are default."Trans"."customerId", default."Trans".id, default."Trans"."inventoryId", default."Trans"."rentalDate", default."Trans"."returnDate", default."Trans"."staffId", default."Trans".updated.

=== RETRY ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
The error is due to the fact that the `filmId` column does not exist in the `Trans` table. Instead, the `inventoryId` column is present, which can be used to retrieve the movie IDs.

Here is the corrected Python script:
```
data = executor.get_from_database("SELECT inventoryId FROM default.Trans WHERE customerId = (SELECT id FROM default.Patron WHERE emailAddr = '<user_email>')")
if len(data) == 0:
  executor.output('No movie preferences found for this user')
else:
  liked_movies = [row["inventoryId"] for row in data]
  executor.output(f'Movies liked by this user: {liked_movies}')
```
This script retrieves the `inventoryId` column from the `Trans` table, which can be used to identify the movies liked by the user.
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===
No movie preferences found for this user
