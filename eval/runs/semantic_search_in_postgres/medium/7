show me city/state/phone number for all the stores that have Core Suit in stock

=== OUTPUT ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
To add context to this conversation, I need to retrieve the city, state, and phone number of stores that have "Core Suit" in stock.

Here is the Python script to retrieve the required data:
```
query = """
  SELECT 
    l.addr1 AS address,
    l.state_distr AS state,
    l.phone_num AS phone,
    c.inventory_id
  FROM public.catalog c
  JOIN public.loc l ON c.store_id = l.id
  WHERE c.film_id IN (
    SELECT m.id
    FROM public.movie m
    WHERE m.title = 'Core Suit'
  )
"""

stores = executor.get_from_database(query)
if len(stores) == 0:
  executor.output('No stores have "Core Suit" in stock')
else:
  executor.output(f'{len(stores)} stores have "Core Suit" in stock:')
  for store in stores:
    executor.output(f'Address: {store["address"]}, State: {store["state"]}, Phone: {store["phone"]}')
```
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===
No stores have "Core Suit" in stock
