=== QUERY PLAN ===
To add context to this conversation, I need to retrieve the full names of employees who handled a transaction along with the id of the rental transaction, for all rentals handled by an employee no longer working here.

Here is the Python script to retrieve the required data:
```
data = executor.get_from_database("""
    SELECT 
      t.id AS transaction_id,
      CONCAT(te.first_name, ' ', te.last_name) AS employee_full_name
    FROM public.trans t
    JOIN public.team te ON t.staff_id = te.id
    WHERE te.active = FALSE
""")

if len(data) == 0:
  executor.output('No transactions found handled by inactive employees')
else:
  executor.output('Transactions handled by inactive employees:')
  for row in data:
    executor.output(f'Transaction ID: {row["transaction_id"]}, Employee Full Name: {row["employee_full_name"]}')
```
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===
No transactions found handled by inactive employees
