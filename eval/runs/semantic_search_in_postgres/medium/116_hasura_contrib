=== INPUT ===
what was the most frequently rented movie for each of the stores in the last month

=== OUTPUT ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
To answer this question, we need to retrieve the most frequently rented movie for each store in the last month. We can do this by joining the `trans` table (which contains rental information) with the `catalog` table (which contains inventory information) and the `movie` table (which contains movie information). We'll also need to filter the results to only include rentals from the last month.

Here's the Python script to retrieve the data:
```
query = """
  WITH recent_rentals AS (
    SELECT 
      t.store_id, 
      m.title, 
      COUNT(t.id) AS rental_count
    FROM 
      trans t
    JOIN 
      catalog c ON t.inventory_id = c.inventory_id
    JOIN 
      movie m ON c.film_id = m.id
    WHERE 
      t.rental_date > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 month'
    GROUP BY 
      t.store_id, 
      m.title
  )
  SELECT 
    store_id, 
    title, 
    rental_count
  FROM 
    recent_rentals
  WHERE 
    (store_id, rental_count) IN (
      SELECT 
        store_id, 
        MAX(rental_count) 
      FROM 
        recent_rentals 
      GROUP BY 
        store_id
    )
"""

data = executor.get_from_database(query)

if len(data) == 0:
  executor.output('No rentals found in the last month')
else:
  executor.output('Most frequently rented movie for each store in the last month:')
  for row in data:
    executor.output(f'Store ID: {row["store_id"]}, Movie: {row["title"]}, Rentals: {row["rental_count"]}')
```
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===

Traceback (most recent call last):

=== RETRY ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
The error is because the `trans` table does not have a `store_id` column. Instead, we need to join the `trans` table with the `catalog` table, which has a `store_id` column.

Here's the corrected Python script:
```
query = """
  WITH recent_rentals AS (
    SELECT 
      c.store_id, 
      m.title, 
      COUNT(t.id) AS rental_count
    FROM 
      trans t
    JOIN 
      catalog c ON t.inventory_id = c.inventory_id
    JOIN 
      movie m ON c.film_id = m.id
    WHERE 
      t.rental_date > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 month'
    GROUP BY 
      c.store_id, 
      m.title
  )
  SELECT 
    store_id, 
    title, 
    rental_count
  FROM 
    recent_rentals
  WHERE 
    (store_id, rental_count) IN (
      SELECT 
        store_id, 
        MAX(rental_count) 
      FROM 
        recent_rentals 
      GROUP BY 
        store_id
    )
"""

data = executor.get_from_database(query)

if len(data) == 0:
  executor.output('No rentals found in the last month')
else:
  executor.output('Most frequently rented movie for each store in the last month:')
  for row in data:
    executor.output(f'Store ID: {row["store_id"]}, Movie: {row["title"]}, Rentals: {row["rental_count"]}')
```
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===
No rentals found in the last month
