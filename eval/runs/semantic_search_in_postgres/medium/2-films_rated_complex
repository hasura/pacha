=== QUERY PLAN ===
To add context to this conversation, I need to retrieve the titles of French PG13 movies from the database. 

Here is the Python script to retrieve the required data:
```
data = executor.get_from_database("""
    SELECT m.title 
    FROM public.movie m 
    JOIN public.lang l ON m.language_id = l.language_id 
    WHERE m.rated = 'PG-13' AND (l.lang = 'French' OR m.language_orig = l.language_id AND l.lang = 'French')
""")

if len(data) == 0:
  executor.output('No French PG13 movies found')
else:
  executor.output('Titles of French PG13 movies:')
  for movie in data:
    executor.output(movie["title"])
```
