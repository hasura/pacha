Has Tom Cruise done any films in Spanish?

=== OUTPUT ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
To add context to this conversation, I would like to retrieve information about Tom Cruise's filmography, specifically looking for films where he acted and the language of the film is Spanish.

```
query = """
    SELECT 
      m.title,
      m.language_id,
      l.lang
    FROM public.movie m
    JOIN public.movie_cm mc ON m.id = mc.film_id
    JOIN public.castmember c ON mc.id = c.id
    JOIN public.lang l ON m.language_id = l.language_id
    WHERE c.given_name = 'Tom' AND c.surname = 'Cruise'
"""

data = executor.get_from_database(query)
if len(data) == 0:
  executor.output('No films found with Tom Cruise')
else:
  executor.output('Films with Tom Cruise:')
  for film in data:
    if film["lang"] == 'Spanish':
      executor.output(f'Title: {film["title"]}, Language: {film["lang"]}')
    else:
      executor.output(f'Title: {film["title"]}, Language: {film["lang"]} (not Spanish)')
```
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===
No films found with Tom Cruise
