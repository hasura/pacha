which of my customers have birthdays this month

=== OUTPUT ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
To answer this question, we need to retrieve the customers' birthdates from the database. 

We need to retrieve the customers' information from the "patron" table, specifically their birthdates. Since we don't have a birthdate column in the "patron" table, we can't directly retrieve the customers' birthdays. However, we can suggest adding a birthdate column to the "patron" table to store this information.

If the birthdate column is added, we can use the following Python script to retrieve the customers with birthdays this month:

```
import datetime

current_month = datetime.datetime.now().month

query = """
  SELECT 
    id, 
    given_name, 
    surname, 
    email_addr
  FROM public.patron
  WHERE EXTRACT(MONTH FROM birthdate) = %s
"""

data = executor.get_from_database(query, (current_month,))

if len(data) == 0:
  executor.output('No customers have birthdays this month')
else:
  executor.output(f'The following customers have birthdays this month:')
  for customer in data:
    executor.output(f'ID: {customer["id"]}\nName: {customer["given_name"]} {customer["surname"]}\nEmail: {customer["email_addr"]}\n')
```

This script retrieves the customers whose birth month matches the current month. It then outputs the customers' IDs, names, and email addresses.

The error is due to the way I'm calling the `executor.get_from_database` function. It expects only one argument, which is the SQL query. However, I'm passing two arguments: the query and the parameter.

To fix this, we need to pass the parameter as a separate argument. Here's the corrected script:

```
import datetime

current_month = datetime.datetime.now().month

query = """
  SELECT 
    id, 
    given_name, 
    surname, 
    email_addr
  FROM public.patron
  WHERE EXTRACT(MONTH FROM birthdate) = %s
"""

data = executor.get_from_database(query, (current_month))

if len(data) == 0:
  executor.output('No customers have birthdays this month')
else:
  executor.output(f'The following customers have birthdays this month:')
  for customer in data:
    executor.output(f'ID: {customer["id"]}\nName: {customer["given_name"]} {customer["surname"]}\nEmail: {customer["email_addr"]}\n')
```

should be:

```
import datetime

current_month = datetime.datetime.now().month

query = """
  SELECT 
    id, 
    given_name, 
    surname, 
    email_addr
  FROM public.patron
  WHERE EXTRACT(MONTH FROM birthdate) = %s
"""

data = executor.get_from_database(query % current_month)

if len(data) == 0:
  executor.output('No customers have birthdays this month')
else:
  executor.output(f'The following customers have birthdays this month:')
  for customer in data:
    executor.output(f'ID: {customer["id"]}\nName: {customer["given_name"]} {customer["surname"]}\nEmail: {customer["email_addr"]}\n')
```

Now, the `executor.get_from_database` function is called with a single argument, which is the SQL query with the parameter inserted.

I apologize for the mistake. The error is due to the way I'm calling the `executor.get_from_database` function. It expects a single string argument, which is the SQL query. However, I'm passing the query and the parameter as separate arguments.

To fix this, we need to use string formatting to insert the parameter into the query. Here's the corrected script:

```
import datetime

current_month = datetime.datetime.now().month

query = """
  SELECT 
    id, 
    given_name, 
    surname, 
    email_addr
  FROM public.patron
  WHERE EXTRACT(MONTH FROM birthdate) = {}
""".format(current_month)

data = executor.get_from_database(query)

if len(data) == 0:
  executor.output('No customers have birthdays this month')
else:
  executor.output(f'The following customers have birthdays this month:')
  for customer in data:
    executor.output(f'ID: {customer["id"]}\nName: {customer["given_name"]} {customer["surname"]}\nEmail: {customer["email_addr"]}\n')
```

Now, the `executor.get_from_database` function is called with a single argument, which is the SQL query with the parameter inserted.

The error is due to the fact that the "birthdate" column does not exist in the "patron" table. 

Since the "patron" table does not have a "birthdate" column, we cannot retrieve the customers' birthdays. We need to add a "birthdate" column to the "patron" table to store this information.

If the "birthdate" column is added, the script should work correctly. However, if we cannot add a "birthdate" column, we cannot retrieve the customers' birthdays.

Here's the corrected script, assuming the "birthdate" column is added:

```
import datetime

current_month = datetime.datetime.now().month

query = """
  SELECT 
    id, 
    given_name, 
    surname, 
    email_addr
  FROM public.patron
  WHERE EXTRACT(MONTH FROM birthdate) = {}
""".format(current_month)

data = executor.get_from_database(query)

if len(data) == 0:
  executor.output('No customers have birthdays this month')
else:
  executor.output(f'The following customers have birthdays this month:')
  for customer in data:
    executor.output(f'ID: {customer["id"]}\nName: {customer["given_name"]} {customer["surname"]}\nEmail: {customer["email_addr"]}\n')
```

Please note that you need to add the "birthdate" column to the "patron" table for this script to work.
