=== INPUT ===
Suggest a children's' movie by popularity

=== OUTPUT ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
To suggest a popular children's movie, I would like to retrieve the top-rated children's movies from the database.

```
query = """
  SELECT 
    m.title,
    AVG(r.rating) AS avg_rating
  FROM public.movie m
  JOIN public.movie_list ml ON m.id = ml.fid
  JOIN public.payment_p2022_01 p ON m.id = p.rental_id
  WHERE m.rated IN ('G', 'PG') AND ml.category = 'Children'
  GROUP BY m.title
  ORDER BY avg_rating DESC
  LIMIT 1
"""

data = executor.get_from_database(query)
if len(data) == 0:
  executor.output('No children movies found')
else:
  executor.output(f'The most popular children movie is: {data[0]["title"]} with an average rating of {data[0]["avg_rating"]}')
```
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===

=== RETRY ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
The error is due to the fact that there is no table named "r" in the database. The table "r" is supposed to be an alias for a ratings table, but it's not defined in the query.

However, based on the provided database schema, there is no ratings table. The payment tables (payment_p2022_01, payment_p2022_02, etc.) do not have a rating column. 

If we assume that the rating is not available in the database, we can modify the query to suggest a popular children's movie based on the number of payments (i.e., rentals).

Here's the modified query:

```
query = """
  SELECT 
    m.title,
    COUNT(p.id) AS rental_count
  FROM public.movie m
  JOIN public.movie_list ml ON m.id = ml.fid
  JOIN public.catalog c ON m.id = c.film_id
  JOIN public.trans p ON c.inventory_id = p.inventory_id
  WHERE m.rated IN ('G', 'PG') AND ml.category = 'Children'
  GROUP BY m.title
  ORDER BY rental_count DESC
  LIMIT 1
"""

data = executor.get_from_database(query)
if len(data) == 0:
  executor.output('No children movies found')
else:
  executor.output(f'The most popular children movie is: {data[0]["title"]} with {data[0]["rental_count"]} rentals')
```
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===
The most popular children movie is: DOGMA FAMILY with 30 rentals
