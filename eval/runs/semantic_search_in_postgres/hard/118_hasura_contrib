=== INPUT ===
which of my stores is trending downwards in sales over the last 6 months and which ones are trending up

=== OUTPUT ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
To answer this question, we need to retrieve sales data for each store over the last 6 months and analyze the trend.

Here is the Python script to retrieve the required data:
```
query = """
  SELECT 
    s.store, 
    SUM(p.amount) AS total_sales, 
    DATE_TRUNC('month', p.payment_date) AS month
  FROM public.paymant p
  JOIN public.franchise_unit s ON p.handled_by = s.id
  WHERE p.payment_date > NOW() - INTERVAL '6 months'
  GROUP BY s.store, month
  ORDER BY month
"""

data = executor.get_from_database(query)

if len(data) == 0:
  executor.output('No sales data found for the last 6 months')
else:
  executor.output('Sales data for each store over the last 6 months:')
  for row in data:
    executor.output(f'Store: {row["store"]}, Month: {row["month"]}, Total Sales: {row["total_sales"]}')
```
This script retrieves the total sales for each store, grouped by month, over the last 6 months. The output will show the sales trend for each store, allowing us to identify which ones are trending upwards or downwards.

=== QUERY PLAN ===
The error message indicates that the column `store` does not exist in the `franchise_unit` table. Upon reviewing the database schema, I see that the `franchise_unit` table does not have a `store` column. Instead, it has an `id` column and an `address_id` column.

To fix the script, we need to join the `franchise_unit` table with the `loc` table to get the store address, and then group the sales by store address. Here is the corrected script:
```
query = """
  SELECT 
    l.addr1 AS store, 
    SUM(p.amount) AS total_sales, 
    DATE_TRUNC('month', p.payment_date) AS month
  FROM public.paymant p
  JOIN public.franchise_unit fu ON p.handled_by = fu.id
  JOIN public.loc l ON fu.address_id = l.id
  WHERE p.payment_date > NOW() - INTERVAL '6 months'
  GROUP BY l.addr1, month
  ORDER BY month
"""

data = executor.get_from_database(query)

if len(data) == 0:
  executor.output('No sales data found for the last 6 months')
else:
  executor.output('Sales data for each store over the last 6 months:')
  for row in data:
    executor.output(f'Store: {row["store"]}, Month: {row["month"]}, Total Sales: {row["total_sales"]}')
```
This script should now correctly retrieve the sales data for each store over the last 6 months.
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===
No sales data found for the last 6 months
