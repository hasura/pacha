"Stack rank all the stores by their efficiency (efficiency = DVD rented/ DVD inventory

=== OUTPUT ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
To provide more context to this conversation, I need to retrieve the DVD rental and inventory data for each store. 

Here is the Python script to retrieve the required data:
```
query = """
  SELECT 
    s.id AS store_id,
    s.address_id,
    COUNT(DISTINCT t.inventory_id) AS dvd_rented,
    COUNT(c.inventory_id) AS dvd_inventory
  FROM public.trans t
  JOIN public.catalog c ON t.inventory_id = c.inventory_id
  JOIN public.franchise_unit s ON c.store_id = s.id
  GROUP BY s.id, s.address_id
  ORDER BY dvd_rented / dvd_inventory DESC
"""

data = executor.get_from_database(query)
if len(data) == 0:
  executor.output('No data found')
else:
  executor.output('Stack rank of stores by efficiency:')
  for store in data:
    executor.output(f'Store ID: {store["store_id"]}, Address ID: {store["address_id"]}, Efficiency: {store["dvd_rented"] / store["dvd_inventory"]}')
```
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 14, in <module>
  File "/Users/abhg/hasura/ai-engine/pacha/query_planner/python_executor.py", line 34, in get_from_database
    data = self.data_engine.execute_sql(sql)

LINE 10:   ORDER BY dvd_rented / dvd_inventory DESC) AS t
                    ^


=== RETRY ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
The error is due to the fact that I'm trying to use the aliases `dvd_rented` and `dvd_inventory` in the `ORDER BY` clause, which are not valid column names. 

Here is the corrected Python script:
```
query = """
  SELECT 
    s.id AS store_id,
    s.address_id,
    COUNT(DISTINCT t.inventory_id) AS dvd_rented,
    COUNT(c.inventory_id) AS dvd_inventory,
    COUNT(DISTINCT t.inventory_id) / COUNT(c.inventory_id) AS efficiency
  FROM public.trans t
  JOIN public.catalog c ON t.inventory_id = c.inventory_id
  JOIN public.franchise_unit s ON c.store_id = s.id
  GROUP BY s.id, s.address_id
  ORDER BY COUNT(DISTINCT t.inventory_id) / COUNT(c.inventory_id) DESC
"""

data = executor.get_from_database(query)
if len(data) == 0:
  executor.output('No data found')
else:
  executor.output('Stack rank of stores by efficiency:')
  for store in data:
    executor.output(f'Store ID: {store["store_id"]}, Address ID: {store["address_id"]}, Efficiency: {store["efficiency"]}')
```
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===
Stack rank of stores by efficiency:
Store ID: 1, Address ID: 129, Efficiency: 0
Store ID: 2, Address ID: 12, Efficiency: 0
