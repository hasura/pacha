=== INPUT ===
Which Tom Cruise DVDs contain extra footage of him bragging about doing his own stunts?

=== OUTPUT ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
To add context to this conversation, I think it would be useful to retrieve a list of Tom Cruise movies that feature him performing his own stunts, along with any special features or behind-the-scenes footage that might be relevant to the user's query.

Here's a Python script to retrieve this data:
```
query = """
  SELECT 
    m.title,
    mc.special_features
  FROM public.movie m
  JOIN public.movie_cm mc ON m.id = mc.film_id
  JOIN public.castmember c ON mc.id = c.id
  WHERE c.given_name = 'Tom' AND c.surname = 'Cruise'
  AND m.special_features LIKE '%behind the scenes%' OR m.special_features LIKE '%stunts%'
  ORDER BY m.release_year DESC
"""

data = executor.get_from_database(query)
if len(data) == 0:
  executor.output('No Tom Cruise movies with stunt-related special features found')
else:
  executor.output('Tom Cruise movies with stunt-related special features:')
  for movie in data:
    executor.output(f'Title: {movie["title"]}, Special Features: {movie["special_features"]}')
```
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 13, in <module>
  File "/Users/abhg/hasura/ai-engine/pacha/query_planner/python_executor.py", line 34, in get_from_database
    data = self.data_engine.execute_sql(sql)

LINE 3:     mc.special_features
            ^
HINT:  Perhaps you meant to reference the column "m.special_features".


=== RETRY ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
The error is due to the fact that the `special_features` column is actually in the `movie` table, not the `movie_cm` table. Here's the corrected script:
```
query = """
  SELECT 
    m.title,
    m.special_features
  FROM public.movie m
  JOIN public.movie_cm mc ON m.id = mc.film_id
  JOIN public.castmember c ON mc.id = c.id
  WHERE c.given_name = 'Tom' AND c.surname = 'Cruise'
  AND m.special_features LIKE '%behind the scenes%' OR m.special_features LIKE '%stunts%'
  ORDER BY m.release_year DESC
"""

data = executor.get_from_database(query)
if len(data) == 0:
  executor.output('No Tom Cruise movies with stunt-related special features found')
else:
  executor.output('Tom Cruise movies with stunt-related special features:')
  for movie in data:
    executor.output(f'Title: {movie["title"]}, Special Features: {movie["special_features"]}')
```
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===

HINT:  No operator matches the given name and argument types. You might need to add explicit type casts.


=== RETRY ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
The error is due to the fact that the `special_features` column is an array of text, and the `LIKE` operator is not defined for arrays. We need to use the `ANY` function to check if any element of the array matches the pattern. Here's the corrected script:
```
query = """
  SELECT 
    m.title,
    m.special_features
  FROM public.movie m
  JOIN public.movie_cm mc ON m.id = mc.film_id
  JOIN public.castmember c ON mc.id = c.id
  WHERE c.given_name = 'Tom' AND c.surname = 'Cruise'
  AND ('behind the scenes' = ANY(m.special_features) OR 'stunts' = ANY(m.special_features))
  ORDER BY m.release_year DESC
"""

data = executor.get_from_database(query)
if len(data) == 0:
  executor.output('No Tom Cruise movies with stunt-related special features found')
else:
  executor.output('Tom Cruise movies with stunt-related special features:')
  for movie in data:
    executor.output(f'Title: {movie["title"]}, Special Features: {movie["special_features"]}')
```
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===
No Tom Cruise movies with stunt-related special features found
