"Give me top N stores by revenue by DVD category (Comedy

=== OUTPUT ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
To provide more context to this conversation, I need to retrieve the top N stores by revenue for Comedy DVDs. 

Here is the Python script to retrieve the required data:
```
query = """
  SELECT 
    s.id AS store_id,
    s.address_id,
    SUM(c.rate * ca.inventory_id) AS total_revenue
  FROM 
    public.catalog ca
  JOIN 
    public.movie m ON ca.film_id = m.id
  JOIN 
    public.movie_cat mc ON m.id = mc.film_id
  JOIN 
    public.cat c ON mc.category_id = c.id
  JOIN 
    public.franchise_unit fu ON ca.store_id = fu.id
  WHERE 
    c.name = 'Comedy'
  GROUP BY 
    s.id, s.address_id
  ORDER BY 
    total_revenue DESC
  LIMIT N
"""

data = executor.get_from_database(query)
if len(data) == 0:
  executor.output('No stores found with Comedy DVDs')
else:
  executor.output(f'Top {len(data)} stores by revenue for Comedy DVDs are:')
  for store in data:
    executor.output(f'Store ID: {store["store_id"]}, Address ID: {store["address_id"]}, Total Revenue: {store["total_revenue"]}')
```
This script will retrieve the top N stores by revenue for Comedy DVDs, along with their store IDs, address IDs, and total revenue.

The error is due to the fact that I forgot to include the `franchise_unit` table alias `s` in the `FROM` clause. Here is the corrected script:
```
query = """
  SELECT 
    fu.id AS store_id,
    fu.address_id,
    SUM(c.rate * ca.inventory_id) AS total_revenue

    public.movie m ON ca.film_id = m.id
  JOIN 
    public.movie_cat mc ON m.id = mc.film_id
  JOIN 
    public.cat c ON mc.category_id = c.id
  JOIN 
    public.franchise_unit fu ON ca.store_id = fu.id
  WHERE 
    c.name = 'Comedy'
  GROUP BY 
    fu.id, fu.address_id
  ORDER BY 
    total_revenue DESC
  LIMIT N
"""

data = executor.get_from_database(query)
if len(data) == 0:
  executor.output('No stores found with Comedy DVDs')
else:
  executor.output(f'Top {len(data)} stores by revenue for Comedy DVDs are:')
  for store in data:
    executor.output(f'Store ID: {store["store_id"]}, Address ID: {store["address_id"]}, Total Revenue: {store["total_revenue"]}')
```
I added the `fu` alias to the `FROM` clause and also updated the `GROUP BY` clause to use the correct table alias.

HINT:  Perhaps you meant to reference the column "m.rate".

The error is due to the fact that the `rate` column does not exist in the `cat` table, but rather in the `movie` table. Here is the corrected script:

query = """

```
I replaced `c.rate` with `m.rate` in the `SUM` function, as the `rate` column exists in the `movie` table, not the `cat` table.

The error is due to the fact that I used `N` in the `LIMIT` clause, which is not a valid value. I should replace `N` with a specific number, for example, 10. Here is the corrected script:
```
query = """
  SELECT 
    fu.id AS store_id,
    fu.address_id,
    SUM(m.rate * ca.inventory_id) AS total_revenue

  WHERE 
    c.name = 'Comedy'

    fu.id, fu.address_id

data = executor.get_from_database(query)
if len(data) == 0:
  executor.output('No stores found with Comedy DVDs')

  for store in data:
    executor.output(f'Store ID: {store["store_id"]}, Address ID: {store["address_id"]}, Total Revenue: {store["total_revenue"]}')
```
I replaced `LIMIT N` with `LIMIT 10`, which will retrieve the top 10 stores by revenue for Comedy DVDs.
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===
Top 2 stores by revenue for Comedy DVDs are:
Store ID: 2, Address ID: 12, Total Revenue: 1948564.47
Store ID: 1, Address ID: 129, Total Revenue: 1649242.27
