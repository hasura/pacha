=== INPUT ===
Which is the closest video shop to my parent's house at postcode <blah>?

=== OUTPUT ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
To add context to this conversation, I need to retrieve the closest franchise unit (video shop) to the user's parent's house based on the provided postcode.

```
data = executor.get_from_database("SELECT fu.id, fu.address_id, l.addr1, l.city, l.zip FROM public.franchise_unit fu JOIN public.loc l ON fu.address_id = l.id WHERE l.zip = '<blah>' ORDER BY l.addr1 LIMIT 1")
if len(data) == 0:
  executor.output('No video shop found near the provided postcode')
else:
  executor.output(f'Closest video shop to postcode <blah> is at {data[0]["addr1"]}, {data[0]["city"]}, {data[0]["zip"]} with ID {data[0]["id"]}')
```
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 1, in <module>
  File "/Users/abhg/hasura/ai-engine/pacha/query_planner/python_executor.py", line 34, in get_from_database

=== RETRY ===

=== QUERY PLAN ===
The error is due to the column "city" not existing in the "loc" table. The correct column name is "city_id". However, we need the city name, not the city ID. We need to join the "loc" table with the "muni" table to get the city name.

Here is the corrected script:

```
data = executor.get_from_database("SELECT fu.id, fu.address_id, l.addr1, m.city, l.zip FROM public.franchise_unit fu JOIN public.loc l ON fu.address_id = l.id JOIN public.muni m ON l.city_id = m.id WHERE l.zip = '<blah>' ORDER BY l.addr1 LIMIT 1")
if len(data) == 0:
  executor.output('No video shop found near the provided postcode')
else:
  executor.output(f'Closest video shop to postcode <blah> is at {data[0]["addr1"]}, {data[0]["city"]}, {data[0]["zip"]} with ID {data[0]["id"]}')
```
=== EXECUTION RESULT ===
No video shop found near the provided postcode
